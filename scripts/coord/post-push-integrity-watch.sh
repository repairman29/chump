#
# Daemon: detect "post-push PR auto-close" incidents where a stale-base force-push
# causes GitHub to auto-close a PR (the pushed SHA was already on main), then
# AUTO-REOPEN the PR, emit a WARN ambient event, and broadcast an URGENT-INBOX alert.
#
# Incident that motivated this (2026-05-25T19:00Z):
#   wizard pushed stale main HEAD to chump/infra-1974-claim via
#   `git push origin HEAD:chump/infra-1974-claim --force-with-lease` from a stale
#   worktree. GitHub auto-closed PR #2582 because the pushed SHA was already on main.
#   Manual recovery via git reflog + gh pr reopen worked but cost time + risked silent
#   data loss.
#
# Detection heuristic (runs every 60s via launchd):
#   1. Enumerate open+closed PRs on chump/<gap>-* branches updated in the last 120s
#   2. If any PR with a chump/* branch is CLOSED (not MERGED), and was closed within
#      120s of a push (detected by comparing closedAt vs git reflog push timestamps),
#      treat it as a stale-base auto-close incident.
#   3. Auto-reopen the PR, emit kind=post_push_auto_close_recovered to ambient.jsonl,
#      and broadcast CRIT to fleet-wide urgent inbox.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/coord/post-push-integrity-watch.sh           # single-shot check
#   bash scripts/coord/post-push-integrity-watch.sh --dry-run # detect only, no reopen
#
# Install as daemon:
#   scripts/setup/install-post-push-integrity-launchd.sh
#
# Telemetry:
#   kind=post_push_auto_close_recovered — PR was auto-closed after push; reopened
#   kind=post_push_integrity_watch_ok   — scan ran, no incidents found
#   kind=post_push_integrity_watch_err  — gh API call failed or script error
#
# Environment:
#   CHUMP_POST_PUSH_WATCH_WINDOW_S  — how far back to look for closed PRs (default 120)
#   CHUMP_POST_PUSH_WATCH_BRANCH_RE — branch prefix pattern (default 'chump/')
#   CHUMP_REPO                      — repo root (default: git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
#
# scanner-anchor: "kind":"post_push_auto_close_recovered"
