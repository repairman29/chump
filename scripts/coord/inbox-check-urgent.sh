# scripts/coord/inbox-check-urgent.sh — INFRA-2016 (the real keystone) + INFRA-2341
#
# Reads the GLOBAL urgent inbox (.chump-locks/URGENT-INBOX.jsonl) that
# every agent's PostToolUse + SessionStart hook chain checks, regardless of
# session resolution.
#
# Why a global inbox?
#   Investigation 2026-05-25T19:40Z found 8 of 10 curators with non-empty
#   inbox files had NEVER read them — cursor=empty. The existing inbox-poll
#   (INFRA-1860) only fires when an agent's CHUMP_SESSION_ID matches an
#   inbox file. Most curator sessions are operator-spawned standalone
#   Claude windows without CHUMP_SESSION_ID. So their session-keyed inbox
#   never gets polled. Messages were correctly delivered + dead-lettered.
#
# The fix: CRIT/EMERGENCY messages go to a GLOBAL inbox file. Every
# agent's hook reads from it. Bypasses session-resolution for the
# class of messages that MUST get through.
#
# INFRA-2341 — fix_trunk_priority_signal special-handling:
#   The fix-trunk-dispatcher writes a CRIT entry with kind=fix_trunk_priority_signal
#   when it claims a fix-trunk gap (signal mode, default). This helper detects
#   the kind tag and surfaces it above normal CRIT messages with a distinct
#   ** FIX-TRUNK PRIORITY SIGNAL ** banner so the operator's IDE session
#   pivots to clearing trunk red BEFORE continuing other work. Cursor advance
#   + the fix_trunk_session_acknowledged ambient emit are the "this signal
#   has been delivered" handshake — the same entry is not re-surfaced on
#   the next tool call. If multiple fix_trunk signals batch into one tick,
#   one fix_trunk_session_acknowledged event per gap_id is emitted.
#
# Output format (when global urgent inbox has unread):
#   <system-reminder>
#   ** INBOX URGENT (INFRA-2016 global) **
#   <inbox-interrupt urgency="..." from="..." kind="..." gap_id="..." ts="...">
#   body
#   </inbox-interrupt>
#   </system-reminder>
#
# State: .chump-locks/URGENT-INBOX.cursor stores byte offset
#
# Performance: <50ms on cold cache (single file stat + grep). Safe to
# call on every PostToolUse.
