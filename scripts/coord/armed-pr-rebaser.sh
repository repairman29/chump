# armed-pr-rebaser.sh — INFRA-3473. Fleet self-healing.
#
# The queue-driver rebases BEHIND PRs and conflict-resolver-agent.sh resolves
# conflicts — but only INSIDE a bot-merge run. Once a PR is armed and bot-merge
# exits, nothing re-runs rebase when main later advances, so armed PRs drift to
# CONFLICTING/DIRTY and sit until a human notices (found 2026-07-28: #3347/#3353/
# #3362 sat for hours; 2 of 3 only needed a plain rebase).
#
# This closes that gap: for each open ARMED PR whose mergeStateStatus is DIRTY or
# BEHIND, rebase its branch on origin/main in a throwaway worktree; if the rebase
# is CLEAN, push --force-with-lease (auto-merge then lands it); if there's a REAL
# conflict, abort and emit `armed_pr_needs_conflict_resolution` for a human /
# conflict-resolver — NEVER force-push a broken state.
#
# RESILIENT-350: the worktree used to be built from the bare branch name
# ("$br"), which resolves to whatever LOCAL branch ref happens to exist in
# $ROOT's own git dir — not the freshly-fetched remote tip. If $ROOT ever
# had this branch checked out before (a prior claim/worktree), that local
# ref is stale, and rebasing+force-pushing from it silently reverts any
# commit pushed straight to the PR branch since (e.g. a human/agent manual
# fix). Root-caused live: a manual `chump_gh` fix on #3832 got clobbered
# twice by this exact path before the raw-gh lint was fixed in-source.
# Building the worktree from `origin/$br` (which we just fetched) and
# force-resetting the local branch ref onto it (`-B`) guarantees the
# rebase base is the true remote tip, so it can only ever ADD commits from
# main — never drop commits that already landed on the remote branch.
