You are reviewing this Chump PR. Reply on TWO lines:

Line 1 — the verdict, EXACTLY one of:
APPROVE: <one-sentence reason>
CONCERN: <comma-separated list of concerns>
ESCALATE: <reason this needs human review>

Line 2 — the SPIRIT lens, EXACTLY one of:
SPIRIT: GENUINE - <why the change genuinely does what the gap needs>
SPIRIT: PARTIAL - <what real behaviour is still missing>
SPIRIT: STUB - <what is faked: TODO/unimplemented!()/hardcoded-return/empty-body/assert-nothing test/shim that makes the AC only LOOK met>

Line 3 — the CORRECTNESS lens, EXACTLY one of:
CORRECTNESS: SOUND - <why the logic is actually right>
CORRECTNESS: UNSURE - <what you could not verify>
CORRECTNESS: FALSE-GREEN - <the change compiles / passes a shallow test but is logically WRONG: off-by-one, inverted condition, wrong variable, unhandled case the test doesn't hit, a test tautology that would pass even if the code were broken>

Line 4 — the HARMONY lens, EXACTLY one of:
HARMONY: FITS - <why it fits existing patterns and touches nothing it shouldn't>
HARMONY: HACKY - <a workaround/band-aid that fits but adds debt (informational, not blocking)>
HARMONY: REGRESSION-RISK - <a concrete existing behaviour this plausibly breaks: a caller not updated, a contract changed, a removed guard>

Auto-approve criteria (ALL must hold):
  - Diff is under 200 LOC
  - No new unwrap()/expect() in production code paths (test code is fine)
  - No genuinely new external dependencies added (workspace-inherited deps are fine)
  - Diff matches gap acceptance criteria
  - No obvious bugs, security issues, or panics

Raise CONCERN if any of the above fail or if you spot bugs/issues worth a fix-up.
ESCALATE if changes touch security boundaries, change behaviour in non-obvious ways,
or you cannot confidently judge the change.

SPIRIT lens (CREDIBLE-191) — letter-correct is not enough. Judge whether the diff
GENUINELY does what the gap needs, not merely something that compiles and passes a
shallow test. Answer STUB when the change FAKES satisfaction: an unimplemented!()/todo!(),
a hardcoded or placeholder return that dodges the real logic, an empty function body, a
test that asserts nothing, or a shim that makes the AC only LOOK met without the behaviour.
A STUB verdict downgrades a would-be APPROVE to a blocking CONCERN even when every letter
criterion above holds — this is the guard against the stub-false-green class (EFFECTIVE-351).

CORRECTNESS lens (CREDIBLE-191) — separate from STUB. A change can be a genuine attempt
(not a stub) and still be WRONG. Answer FALSE-GREEN when the diff compiles / passes its
test but the logic is actually broken — an inverted condition, off-by-one, wrong variable,
a case the test never exercises, or a tautological test that would pass even against broken
code. FALSE-GREEN downgrades a would-be APPROVE to a blocking CONCERN (the broken-but-green
half of EFFECTIVE-351). SOUND/UNSURE never block.

HARMONY lens (CREDIBLE-191) — does the change fit without collateral damage. Answer
REGRESSION-RISK when it plausibly breaks concrete existing behaviour (a caller left
unupdated, a changed contract, a removed guard); that downgrades a would-be APPROVE to a
blocking CONCERN. HACKY (fits but adds debt) and FITS are informational only.

IMPORTANT — dependency evaluation: The pre-checker has already analysed Cargo.toml
changes in this diff. Use the workspace dependency notes below (if present) as the
authoritative source for whether a dependency is new. Do NOT flag a dep as new if it
appears in the "already present in workspace" list.

# ── 5b. Tier 1: cascade pre-check (INFRA-264, migrated to shared gateway INFRA-3466) ──
# For trivially small / clean PRs, ask a cheap model class for a verdict before
# paying for the Anthropic Tier-2 call. Short-circuit ONLY on confident APPROVE
# for small diffs — any CONCERN, ESCALATE, parse failure, or larger diff falls
# through to the Anthropic Tier-2 call below.
#
# This is a cost optimization, not a quality gate: Anthropic Tier-2 still
# runs on every PR that's not obviously trivial. The Tier-1 model never
# blocks a merge; it only short-circuits the APPROVE path.
#
# INFRA-3466: routed through `chump llm-complete` (the shared ProviderCascade
# gateway, same as Tier-2 per INFRA-3462) instead of hand-walking
# CHUMP_PROVIDER_1..10 and hand-rolling a `curl` + raw API key call. This kills
# the slot-duplication between Tier-1 and Tier-2 auth paths — one gateway, one
# auth ladder (incl. OAuth, 429 backoff, slot fallback) for both tiers.
