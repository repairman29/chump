# discord-gateway-beat.sh — RESILIENT-370: host-agnostic entrypoint for the
# serenity-free Discord RECEIVE gateway (scripts/ops/discord-gateway.py).
#
# WHY A BEAT WRAPPER, AND WHY IT LIVES HERE. RESILIENT-266 shipped the gateway
# and a manifest `enabled chump-discord-gateway.service` line, but the only unit
# file lived in scripts/ops/ and the only installer was a Mac launchd script.
# The ATC roster (install-fleet-node.sh, TREK-18) derives what to deploy from
# organ-manifest.txt INTERSECTED with the unit files under scripts/dispatch/ —
# so a manifest line with no scripts/dispatch/ unit is declared-but-never-
# installed on every Linux node. helsinki's decommission left the two-way
# operator channel dark with nothing to revive it. This wrapper + its sibling
# unit put the organ where the machinery actually looks.
#
# The wrapper is host-agnostic ON PURPOSE: it self-locates the repo, fixes HOME
# from the run-user, re-resolves creds, and DEGRADES GRACEFULLY (idle, never
# crash-loop) when the token/intent is not available on this node.

# sed only matches `/root/` WITH a trailing slash. Derive HOME from the user we
# actually run as so ~/.chump resolves on every host (Mac, root Linux, CJ).

# the privileged MESSAGE CONTENT intent enabled in the Discord dev portal AND
# CHUMP_DISCORD_GW_INTENTS=36864 (4096|32768) in providers.env. We do NOT force
# 36864: requesting a privileged intent the portal has not granted makes Discord
# close the connection with 4014 (Disallowed intent), which WOULD crash-loop.
# Buttons + `status`/`ping`/`help` work at 4096; a free-text DM gets a one-line
# nudge to enable the intent. This is graceful-degrade for the intent, matching
# the token degrade above.
