# worker-timeout.sh — RESILIENT-135
#
# Pure, unit-testable effort-based timeout scaling for the fleet worker loop.
# Extracted from scripts/dispatch/worker.sh so the scaling can be exercised by
# a real behavioural test (scripts/ci/test-worker-timeout-scale.sh) instead of
# a hand-copied replica.
#
# THE BUG THIS GUARDS (RESILIENT-135): the original inline scaler wrote the
# scaled value back into the *global* base timeout each cycle, so consecutive
# xs gaps (x0.5) compounded the multiplier and collapsed the per-cycle
# claude -p budget toward 0s (observed live: 1800 -> ... -> 14 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0).
# Every spawn was then killed (rc=124) before it could implement anything, which
# is why autonomous worker completion was ~0. The fix is twofold and both halves
# live here so they cannot drift apart:
#   1. derive ONLY from the immutable base the caller passes in (never from the
#      previous result), and
#   2. a hard floor so the budget can never collapse below a workable minimum.
#
# Usage:
#   compute_scaled_timeout BASE_S EFFORT [MAX_S] [MIN_S]   -> echoes scaled seconds
#     EFFORT multipliers: xs=0.5  s=1.0  m=1.5  l=2.0  xl=3.0  (unknown -> 1.0)
#     MAX_S default: $CHUMP_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MAX_S or 7200
#     MIN_S default: $CHUMP_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MIN_S or 120

    out=$(( base * n / d ))
    # Cap, then floor. Floor wins last so the budget can NEVER collapse to ~0
    # (the death-spiral guard) even if a caller passes a tiny/zero base.
