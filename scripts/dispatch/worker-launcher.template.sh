# worker-launcher.template.sh — RESILIENT-1099: tracked, node-neutral worker
# launcher template.
#
# Before this file existed, every node ran a hand-deployed, git-UNTRACKED
# launcher (e.g. ~/node1-worker-run.sh) that baked in PATH, WORKER_SKILLS,
# and FLEET_DOMAIN_FILTER by hand per node. That drift (cuphead's launcher
# hardcoded FLEET_DOMAIN_FILTER=RESILIENT, mugman's hardcoded
# FLEET_DOMAIN_FILTER=EFFECTIVE,CREDIBLE) is the exact class that froze the
# fleet for ~15h on 2026-09-08 (see scripts/setup/worker-policy.env). Nothing
# in git described the launcher, so nothing could review, reproduce, or heal
# it, and a fresh node had no one-command way to get a correct one.
#
# This template is rendered by render_worker_launcher() in
# scripts/setup/chump-node-install.sh — node identity (AGENT_ID /
# WORKER_MACHINE / FLEET_SESSION / WORKER_SKILLS / FLEET_DOMAIN_FILTER /
# REPO_ROOT) is the ONLY per-node input. Self-heal policy and model-routing
# come from the tracked scripts/setup/worker-policy.env and
# scripts/setup/model-escalation-ladder.env, which worker.sh sources itself
# — so this template does NOT duplicate that policy, it only supplies
# identity. Never hand-edit a rendered launcher; edit THIS template (or the
# policy files above) and re-render via `chump-node-install.sh
# --reconcile-organs-only`, or the drift comes back on the next re-provision.
#
# Placeholders (substituted at render time — never present in a live launcher):
#   __AGENT_ID__            per-node agent id, e.g. "node1-worker"
#   __WORKER_MACHINE__      machine label for A2A / capability routing
#   __FLEET_SESSION__       session tag used in logs / lease naming
#   __WORKER_SKILLS__       comma-separated capability tags (may be empty)
#   __FLEET_DOMAIN_FILTER__ comma-separated domain filter (may be empty = any)
#   __REPO_ROOT__           absolute path to this node's chump checkout
#   __FLEET_MODEL__         model CLASS for the effort gate: haiku|sonnet|opus.
#                           INFRA-471: a sonnet worker REFUSES effort=xs, a haiku
#                           worker REFUSES m/l/xl (see _pick_and_claim_gap.py).
#                           This is how a haiku-class instance eats the xs backlog
#                           a sonnet-only fleet leaves starved. Rendered per
#                           instance so one node can run mixed classes.
#   __FLEET_EFFORT_FILTER__ effort band this instance picks (csv of xs,s,m,l,xl).
