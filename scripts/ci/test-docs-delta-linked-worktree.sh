# CI test: docs-delta commit-msg gate works end-to-end in a linked worktree
# WITHOUT the CHUMP_DOCS_DELTA_CHECK=0 bypass (INFRA-1521).
#
# INFRA-1521 diagnosed a hardcoded $REPO_ROOT/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG path that
# doesn't exist in a linked worktree (.git is a gitdir-pointer FILE there,
# not a directory) — the correct path is $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/COMMIT_EDITMSG,
# resolving to .git/worktrees/<name>/COMMIT_EDITMSG. By the time this test
# was written, the docs-delta enforcement had already moved to the
# commit-msg hook (INFRA-1969) which reads the message from $1 directly —
# no COMMIT_EDITMSG path resolution at all — so the class of bug is
# structurally gone from the live check. This test proves the end-to-end
# behavior (real `git commit` in a real linked worktree) rather than
# grepping hook source for a specific string, so it stays valid across
# future refactors of *how* the message is located.
