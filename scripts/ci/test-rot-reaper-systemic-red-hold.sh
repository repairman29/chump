# test-rot-reaper-systemic-red-hold.sh — RESILIENT-1188 (systemic-red guard)
#
# #4637 taught the rot-reaper's CLASS 2 to SPARE an INDIVIDUAL PR whose real
# gates are green underneath a red `verified` aggregate. But when a SHARED /
# trunk gate breaks, the required aggregate goes RED across MANY open PRs at
# once — each with a genuine COMPLETED failure on that gate — so #4637's per-PR
# classifier reads every one as hard_fail and the reaper closes them ALL. That
# is the fleet-wide self-strangle (INFRA-3542 / auto-rescue-reaps-systemic-red).
#
# THE RELIABLE SYSTEMIC SIGNAL IS MAIN-RED, NOT "N PRs share a gate". Two open
# PRs failing the SAME-NAMED required gate is NOT proof of a shared break — each
# can have its OWN independent real failure in that gate, and those SHOULD still
# reap. The one thing that distinguishes a shared/trunk break from independent
# failures is whether MAIN ITSELF is red — which the reaper CONSUMES from the
# trunk-sentinel-daemon's ambient signal (scripts/coord/trunk-sentinel-daemon.sh).
# When main is green, a required-red PR reaps as before; when main is RED, the
# whole required-red class is HELD (its redness is inherited from the trunk).
#
# This test drives the REAL reaper against its own selection logic
# (CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_PR_JSON fixture, gh/chump stubbed, hermetic ambient) and
# proves:
#   • MAIN GREEN, two PRs failing the SAME-NAMED gate + one failing another →
#     ALL reap (closed=3, held=0) — the exact independent-failure case that must
#     NOT be held (the regression this guard's definition avoids);
#   • MAIN RED (trunk-sentinel ambient) → EVERY required-red PR is HELD
#     (closed=0), and a pr_reap_held_systemic event is emitted;
#   • a STALE trunk-red (older than the freshness window) is ignored → reaps as
#     if main were green.
# plus source-wiring + event-registration asserts.
#
# Depth tier: EDGE — decision-path fixtures across the main-green / main-red /
# stale-red matrix driven through the REAL reaper with stubbed gh/chump and a
# hermetic ambient log, plus source-wiring and EVENT_REGISTRY asserts. Gaps:
# does not spin up a live GitHub, a real `verified` aggregate run, the live
# trunk-sentinel daemon, or the auto-merge-armer / operator-page side effects
# (the re-arm + page glue is covered by source-wiring + counts + the emitted
# event, not live delivery).
