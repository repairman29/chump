# test-stale-binary-ship-blocked.sh — INFRA-825 CI gate
#
# Asserts that the remaining destructive bulk-YAML operation
# (`chump gap dump --per-file`) refuses to run when the chump binary is
# stale relative to the gap-store-affecting code on HEAD.
#
# PR #1444 silently reverted META-044 because a 9-commit-stale chump binary
# regenerated all gap YAMLs from an outdated state.db. This test ensures
# that failure mode is blocked at the binary level, not just warned about.
#
# ZERO-WASTE-020 (2026-07-19): `chump gap ship --update-yaml` no longer
# writes anything (per-file YAML mirrors are retired — state.db is
# canonical, .chump/state.sql is the tracked dump) so it is a documented
# no-op and no longer needs the staleness guard: a no-op can't regenerate
# a stale YAML from an outdated state.db, because it doesn't regenerate
# anything. Only `gap dump --per-file` remains a genuine destructive
# bulk-YAML write (used for ad-hoc offline browsing exports) and stays
# guarded.
#
# The authoritative replay of #1444's failure mode lives in
# src/version.rs::tests::pr_1444_replay_refuses_without_override (and the
# ambient-override emitter test). This script ensures those unit tests
# stay green AND that the binary actually wires them in.
#
# CREDIBLE-237 / CREDIBLE-274: Test 2 grep target was src/main.rs; after
# INFRA-1965 moved gap command code to src/commands/gap.rs, the grep
# became vacuous. Target updated to scan both files so the gate can no
# longer pass silently.
