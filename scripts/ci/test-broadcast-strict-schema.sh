# scripts/ci/test-broadcast-strict-schema.sh — INFRA-1948 (slice E of INFRA-1862)
#
# Smoke test: broadcast.sh --strict schema validation. Verifies:
#   (a) STUCK <gap-id> with no reason succeeds (defaults reason=unspecified)
#       when --strict is NOT given (backward compat, INFRA-1862 AC #7)
#   (b) STUCK <gap-id> with no reason FAILS under --strict with a clear
#       "missing required field: reason" message (the exact bug that
#       motivated INFRA-1862 — positional-arg confusion silently defaulted)
#   (c) STUCK <gap-id> "<reason>" succeeds under --strict when reason given
#   (d) a malformed gap id (e.g. "not-a-gap-id") is rejected under --strict
#       but accepted without --strict
#   (e) ALERT kind=<kind> with no message fails under --strict
