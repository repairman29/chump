# test-discord-curation.sh — RESILIENT-1093: single-voice curation layer.
#
# The bug this guards: 18 independent notify_operator call sites each dial
# Discord the moment they have something page-worthy to say. When several
# organs fire in the same window (a real production shape — see the gap's
# evidence: pr-approval-surface-beat, board-cycle-escalate, discord-advisor
# etc. all post directly), the operator gets N separate DMs instead of one
# curated voice, diverging from docs/DISCORD_OPERATOR_CONSOLE.md's "one
# curated voice, never a firehose" surface.
#
# This test proves the fix directly: fire 3 page-worthy signals from 3
# different sources, assert NONE of them attempt an immediate Discord send
# (they should defer into the curation queue), then flush the queue and
# assert exactly ONE combined send is attempted.
