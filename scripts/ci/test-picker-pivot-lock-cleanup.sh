# Verifies that worker.sh removes .gap-<ID>.lock on each pivot path so
# sibling workers can pick the gap in the next cycle:
#   1. preflight fails  → lock released
#   2. origin/main shows status:done → lock released
#   3. worktree-add fails → lock released
#
# These are unit-level checks on the shell logic, not full fleet runs.
# We simulate the pivot paths by checking that the rm -f lines exist
# immediately before each `continue` that follows a successful claim.
