# test-rot-reaper-verified-red-spare.sh — RESILIENT-311 completion (verified-red spare)
#
# PR #4606 taught the stale-pr-reaper to spare green-underneath BLOCKED PRs. But
# a SECOND reaper — the rot-reaper (scripts/ops/rot-reaper.sh, RESILIENT-311) —
# still closed good PRs whose SOLE branch-protection-required check `verified`
# (a slow AGGREGATE over cargo-test/clippy/audit/fast-checks/parity) sat RED past
# an SLO. `verified` goes red for RECOVERABLE reasons: a parity mirror reports
# late, a sub-job is CI-cancelled, a known flake trips, or CI is still finishing.
# The reaper reaped #4598/#4615/#4618 that way — a 22-min-late parity gate, a
# flake, a CI-cancel — destroying correct work that only needed a re-run.
#
# The fix REUSES the #4606 green-underneath classifier
# (scripts/ops/lib/classify-blocked-pr.py) via its opt-in `--blocking-check`
# path: before any CLASS-2 close, the rot-reaper classifies WHY verified is red
# and SPARES the recoverable verdicts (green_underneath / pending / cancelled /
# blocked_no_failure / flake_exhausted) — re-arming instead of closing, and
# escalating past a bound. Only a genuine hard_fail (a COMPLETED failure on a
# real blocking gate) or a conflict is closed.
#
# This test proves BOTH directions end-to-end against the rot-reaper's own
# selection logic (CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_PR_JSON fixture, gh/chump stubbed):
#   • a GREEN-UNDERNEATH verified-red PR is SPARED (re-armed, never closed)
#   • a pending / cancelled / flake verified-red PR is SPARED
#   • a genuine HARD-FAIL verified-red PR is still CLOSED
#   • a human-closed PR is never in the open set → never touched/reopened
# plus a direct classifier fixture matrix for the two new verdicts, and
# source-wiring + event-registration asserts.
#
# Depth tier: EDGE — pure decision-function fixtures across the verified-red
# reason matrix (green-underneath / pending / cancelled / flake / hard-fail /
# conflict) driven through the REAL reaper in --dry-run with stubbed gh/chump,
# plus classifier-unit and source-wiring asserts. Gaps: does not spin up a live
# GitHub PR, a real `verified` aggregate run, or the auto-merge-armer/operator
# escalation side effects (the re-arm/escalate glue is covered by source-wiring
# asserts + the dry-run SPARE lines, not live execution); the flake-budget
# marker path is exercised via the classifier unit, not the reaper's own dir.
