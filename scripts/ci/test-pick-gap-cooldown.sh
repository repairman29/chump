# test-pick-gap-cooldown.sh — INFRA-361 regression test for the rc=1
# cooldown behavior in _pick_gap.py.
#
# Pre-fix: a gap that just produced rc=1 from claude was immediately
# eligible for re-pick on the next cycle. Worker 4 was observed
# re-picking INFRA-340 6 times in 5 minutes. Post-fix: when worker.sh
# writes a cooldown record into $COOLDOWN_DIR/<GAP-ID>.json with
# until > now, _pick_gap.py excludes that gap from candidates until
# the timestamp expires.
#
# Network-free: exercises _pick_gap.py directly with a synthetic
# candidate set + temp cooldown dir.
