# scripts/ci/test-bom-old-manifest-regression.sh — INFRA-7769
#
# docs/strategy/ONE_COMMAND_INSTALL.md section 1 (INFRA-7756, one-command-
# install BOM unification, slice A). INFRA-7768 proved the FOUR unified-BOM
# consumers agree with each other on a synthetic manifest that already has
# platforms=/housekeeping= tokens. This test proves the other half: that a
# REAL, pre-unification organ-manifest.txt — the actual three-separate-
# rosters world this slice replaced (organ-manifest.txt with no platforms=,
# bootstrap-manifest.yaml as an independent installer list, and
# install-node-housekeeping.sh's own hardcoded 10-organ heredoc) — is
# handled the way the design requires, not silently mishandled:
#
#   1. The old-shape manifest still PARSES (organ_manifest_parse is
#      backward-compatible — no crash on a file with zero platforms= lines).
#   2. Every unit's platform defaults to "systemd", exactly as
#      organ-manifest-lib.sh's header documents — proven against a REAL
#      historical file, not just a hand-rolled synthetic one.
#   3. render-organ-roster.sh --platform launchd on the OLD manifest alone
#      renders NOTHING — the concrete, measurable gap unification closed:
#      before INFRA-7765 folded bootstrap-manifest.yaml in, organ-manifest.txt
#      alone could not describe a single macOS-applicable organ.
#   4. housekeeping_organs_from_manifest() on the OLD manifest emits the
#      EXACT documented WARN (INFRA-7766) and falls back to the exact
#      built-in 10-organ roster — the "specific error" this gap's
#      acceptance criteria call for, and the load-bearing proof that the
#      fallback is reachable by a genuinely old file, not just a synthetic
#      one-liner.
#   5. The SAME function, run against the CURRENT real organ-manifest.txt,
#      does NOT emit that WARN and returns the real derived roster instead —
#      so this test only passes because the unified BOM's housekeeping=
#      tokens are present TODAY. Revert INFRA-7766 (or strip organ-
#      manifest.txt back to the old shape) and this assertion is the one
#      that catches it — "the unified BOM is missing" is exactly the
#      condition this test is conditioned on (INFRA-7769 AC #2).
#
# Old-manifest content lives in scripts/ci/fixtures/organ-manifest-pre-
# unification.txt — lines copied verbatim from commit
# e16215781d8c388701140f971235951c010141a1 (the last commit before
# INFRA-7764), frozen as a static fixture rather than fetched via `git show`
# because CI checkouts are shallow (actions/checkout@v7 default depth=1) and
# cannot reach that commit.
