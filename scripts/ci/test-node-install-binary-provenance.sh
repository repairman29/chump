# Regression test for the COTG node-install BINARY-phase provenance gate
# (ribbon: bare box -> one command -> outcome). Guards two properties of
# scripts/setup/chump-node-install.sh:
#
#   1. host_target_triple maps this host to the cargo triple the release
#      workflow publishes, and refuses android/unknown hosts (they build).
#   2. binary_provenance_ok ACCEPTS a release-sha-verified or built-from-HEAD
#      binary and REJECTS a foreign / stale / tampered one — the check that
#      kills the old freeload false-pass (any on-PATH `chump` reported
#      INSTALLED without build or verification).
#
# Network-free + deterministic: it sources the installer (whose top-level run
# is guarded by BASH_SOURCE!=$0) and drives the functions directly with fake
# binaries. Safe to run anywhere; touches only a private temp dir.
