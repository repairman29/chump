# scripts/ci/test-organ-manifest-bom-integration.sh — INFRA-7768
#
# docs/strategy/ONE_COMMAND_INSTALL.md section 1 (INFRA-7756, one-command-
# install BOM unification, slice A). INFRA-7764/7765/7766/7767 each got their
# own unit test (platforms= parsing, bootstrap-manifest.yaml pointers, the
# housekeeping roster derivation, the renderer) but nothing proved the FOUR
# consumers agree with each other against the SAME manifest — that's the
# actual "unified" claim slice A makes: one declared roster, not four that
# happen to individually parse. This test is that integration proof:
#
#   1. A synthetic manifest exercising platforms=/housekeeping=/role=
#      together is parsed identically by organ-manifest-lib.sh (the shared
#      parser), render-organ-roster.sh (the renderer) and
#      node-housekeeping-roster-lib.sh (the housekeeping-organ deriver) —
#      the three independent call sites this slice unified.
#   2. A malformed/missing BOM degrades the way the design requires:
#      organ_manifest_parse and render-organ-roster.sh fail closed (exit
#      non-zero) while housekeeping_organs_from_manifest() fails OPEN with a
#      visible WARN + its documented built-in fallback roster — proving the
#      difference is deliberate, not an accident of three unrelated scripts.
#   3. Against the REAL organ-manifest.txt: every housekeeping= organ is
#      ALSO visible in the systemd renderer's output — the same manifest
#      line drives both consumers, so this fails the moment the two diverge
#      (e.g. a housekeeping= organ mistakenly tagged platforms=launchd-only).
#
# Without INFRA-7764 (platforms=) + INFRA-7766 (housekeeping= roster lib) +
# INFRA-7767 (renderer) all present and mutually consistent, this test fails
# to source the libraries, mis-parses the synthetic manifest, or finds a
# housekeeping organ missing from the renderer's real-manifest output.
