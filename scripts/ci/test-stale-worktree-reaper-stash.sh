# test-stale-worktree-reaper-stash.sh — RESILIENT-029
#
# Verifies that stale-worktree-reaper.sh stashes uncommitted/unpushed work to
# a wip/ branch before reaping, rather than silently destroying it.
#
# Tests:
#   T1: clean worktree (no uncommitted, no unpushed) → reaped normally, no wip branch
#   T2: worktree with uncommitted changes → wip/<gap>-<ts> branch created LOCALLY
#       (RESILIENT-1507: never pushed to origin), ambient event emitted, then
#       worktree reaped
#   T3: worktree with unpushed commits → wip/<gap>-<ts> branch with the commits
#       preserved locally, never pushed to origin, ambient event emitted, then reaped
#   T4: worktree with both uncommitted + unpushed → both preserved in a LOCAL wip
#       branch, then reaped
#   T5 (RESILIENT-1507): even with REMOTE=origin explicitly set, no wip/* ref is
#       ever pushed to origin; the log says the ref is kept local, no "offline?"
#   T6 (RESILIENT-1507): with WIP_PUSH_REMOTE set to a different, non-origin
#       remote, the wip branch IS pushed there — and still never to origin.
#
# Uses a file:// local git remote — no GitHub hits.
#
# Run:
#   ./scripts/ci/test-stale-worktree-reaper-stash.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
