# test-pick-gap-worker-stagger.sh — INFRA-340 regression test.
#
# Pre-fix: every fleet worker called _pick_gap.py with the same inputs at
# boot time, got candidates[0] back, and 4-of-4 raced to the same gap
# (observed 2026-05-02 with chump-squad). Post-fix: WORKER_INDEX rotates
# the pick across the top-N candidates so simultaneously-booting siblings
# spread out instead of colliding.
#
# This test exercises the picker directly with a fixed candidate set and
# four worker indices, and asserts the four picks are pairwise distinct.
