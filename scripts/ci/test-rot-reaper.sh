#   • CONFLICTING + old            → REAP (close+requeue+label)          [324]
#   • CONFLICTING + fresh          → left for owner/rebaser              [324]
#   • BLOCKED-but-mergeable, no
#     required-check failure        → left (needs CI/approval)           [324]
#   • MERGEABLE + REQUIRED check
#     FAILED + old                  → REAP (the raw-gh/bypass rot class) [311]
#   • MERGEABLE + REQUIRED check
#     FAILED + fresh                → left (may be a flake, give it time)[311]
#   • MERGEABLE + green + UNARMED
#     + old                         → ARM (backstop the pr-lander)       [311]
#   • gap-filing PR                 → never touched                      [324]
#   • past-deadline non-terminal
#     hidden class                  → counted in no-abandon backlog      [311]
