# pre-commit-event-registry.sh — INFRA-754
#
# Enforces "observability before scale": refuses any commit that introduces
# a new `"kind":"X"` ambient-event literal unless X is registered in
# docs/observability/EVENT_REGISTRY.yaml.
#
# Rationale:
#   - The fleet emits events into .chump-locks/ambient.jsonl as the
#     load-bearing peripheral-vision substrate. Consumers (fleet-brief,
#     waste-tally, kpi-report, watchdogs) parse these by `kind=`.
#   - When a contributor invents a new `kind` without registering it,
#     consumers silently miss it and the operator loses visibility.
#   - A registry + commit-time guard makes "observability before scale"
#     mechanically enforceable instead of a doctrine doc nobody reads.
#
# Bypass:
#   CHUMP_EVENT_REGISTRY_CHECK=0 git commit ...
#   (commit body should include `Event-Registry-Bypass: <reason>` trailer)
#
# Output: exits 0 silently when no new kinds appear or all are registered;
# exits non-zero with a diagnostic listing offending kind values.
