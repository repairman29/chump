# scripts/ops/lib/organ-unit-install-lib.sh — RESILIENT-1055
#
# The ONE host-agnostic systemd-unit rewriter, shared by install-helsinki-atc.sh
# (the primary-node ATC roster placer) and chump-node-install.sh (the --role
# fresh-node bring-up placer). Before this lib, the host-rewrite sed logic lived
# ONLY inside install-helsinki-atc.sh, so a fresh `chump-node-install --role`
# never placed the role's tracked unit files at all — it only ran
# organ-reconcile's `systemctl enable --now`, which fails on a unit whose file
# was never copied into /etc/systemd/system (-> perpetual `backoff:` for every
# manifest organ that had no file on the box). Extracting the rewriter here lets
# the fresh-node installer PLACE the role roster from the same tracked source,
# host-rewritten identically, so `enable --now` finds a real unit.
#
# WHY host-rewrite at all (RESILIENT-353 / INFRA-3647 / RESILIENT-1051): the
# tracked units in scripts/dispatch/ are NOT all one shape — several are
# helsinki-shaped (User=root, HOME=/root, /root/.cargo) and several are
# CJ-native (User=jeff, /home/jeff/...). Verbatim-copying either shape onto a
# THIRD box (e.g. an ubuntu Oracle node, User=ubuntu, /home/ubuntu) installs a
# unit whose WorkingDirectory/HOME/User don't exist there -> CHDIR/127 every
# cycle, or (the "instruments lie" keystone) a bare `Environment=HOME=/root`
# that survives a naive prefix-rewrite and makes every tool read /root/.config.
# organ_unit_host_rewrite detects each unit's OWN baked-in source user and
# rewrites THAT home, then injects a uniform host-agnostic runtime context, so
# the SAME manifest wires correctly on any host.

# organ_unit_host_rewrite <src-file> <dest-file> <run-user> <run-home> [keep_root] [repo_root]
#   Writes the host-rewritten unit from <src-file> to <dest-file>.
#   run-user / run-home: the box's repo-owning user + that user's real HOME.
#   keep_root (optional, "1"): force User=root even after the rewrite — for the
#     one narrow class of organs whose JOB is the privileged system-unit deploy
#     (chump-organ-deploy.*), which a de-privileged rewrite would break
#     (RESILIENT-374). Everything else runs as the repo-owning user.
#   repo_root (optional): the repo's ACTUAL checkout path on this host, baked
#     into every WorkingDirectory=/ExecStart=/cd/CHUMP_REPO_ROOT= that names the
#     repo. Historically the rewriter only prefix-swapped the source HOME and
#     PRESERVED the baked `Projects/chump` suffix, so an owned node whose repo
#     lives at $HOME/chump (NO Projects segment — the standard owned-iron layout)
#     got units pointing at a non-existent $HOME/Projects/chump and systemd
#     killed every organ at CHDIR (status=200/CHDIR) before it ran — the true
#     root of the fleet-wide "merged != running" disease (RESILIENT-1102). Pass
#     the real checkout root (install-helsinki-atc.sh -> $REPO_ROOT;
#     chump-node-install.sh -> $NODE_DIR/repo) so the paths resolve on any node.
#     Omitting it falls back to the legacy $HOME/Projects/chump assumption, so
#     pre-existing 5-arg callers keep their exact prior behavior.
#   Returns non-zero if <src-file> is missing.

  # RESILIENT-1102 residue: collapse any symlink in the passed repo root to the

  # placer a symlinked repo path (e.g. the hand-bootstrapped
  # /home/ubuntu/Projects/chump -> /home/ubuntu/chump used to unwedge the
  # fleet-wide CHDIR jam): install-helsinki-atc.sh derives its REPO_ROOT with a
  # LOGICAL `pwd`, and organ-deploy passes CHUMP_REPO_ROOT verbatim, so the
  # symlink path flowed straight through this rewriter and every organ baked
  # WorkingDirectory=.../Projects/chump — keeping that bootstrap symlink
  # permanently load-bearing. Resolving here (the ONE chokepoint both placers
  # share) makes the units name the real checkout, so the symlink can be retired.
  # Only resolve a path that actually EXISTS on disk: the legacy no-repo_root

# itself carries — not the invoking installer's shell PATH, which routinely
# disagrees (an installer run as root with ~/.cargo/bin on ITS PATH will
# happily `command -v chump` even when the unit's own injected
# `Environment=PATH=` points at a user/home whose ~/.cargo/bin never got the
# binary symlinked in, e.g. a `User=root` unit left over from an abandoned
# /root/.chumpnode bring-up while the box's real, built binary lives under a
# different user's checkout). That exact drift produced four cuphead organs
