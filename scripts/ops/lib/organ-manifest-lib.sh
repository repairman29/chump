# scripts/ops/lib/organ-manifest-lib.sh — TREK-18 (INFRA-3644), platforms= INFRA-7764
#
# The ONE parser for scripts/ops/organ-manifest.txt, shared by
# organ-reconcile.sh (which converges live systemd state to the manifest)
# and install-helsinki-atc.sh (which now derives its installed roster FROM
# the manifest instead of a second, hand-maintained array). Before this gap,
# the installer's SYSTEM_TIMERS array and the manifest were two independent
# sources of truth — adding an organ to the manifest was NOT sufficient to
# get it installed (chump-conflict-resolution-consumer.timer and
# chump-gap-closure-reconcile.timer were both `enabled` in the manifest but
# absent from the installer's roster until this fix), and RESILIENT-366 had
# to add a standalone CI test just to catch the inverse drift. One parser
# feeding both call sites makes that whole drift class structurally
# impossible instead of separately detected.
#
# Format is documented in scripts/ops/organ-manifest.txt's header comment.
#
# INFRA-7764 (docs/strategy/ONE_COMMAND_INSTALL.md section 1, slice A of the
# one-command-install BOM unification, INFRA-7756): `enabled` lines may also
# carry a `platforms=SYSTEM,SYSTEM,...` token (comma-separated, values
# systemd|launchd|runit). Omitted means `platforms=systemd` — today's
# implicit assumption for every pre-existing line, so nothing regresses.
# This lets organ-manifest.txt absorb bootstrap-manifest.yaml's macOS-only
# capabilities and install-node-housekeeping.sh's roster as ordinary lines
# (`platforms=launchd` / `platforms=systemd` respectively) without a second
# format — the single declared roster every supervisor renders from. Callers
# that don't care about platforms (the 5-arg organ_manifest_parse call) are
# unaffected; a 6th nameref arg opts in to receiving the per-unit platforms
# string so a caller can filter ENABLED to units applicable to the CURRENT
# host (see organ_platform_matches / organ_current_platform below).

# organ_manifest_parse <manifest-file> <paging_off-array-name> <enabled-array-name> <role-assoc-array-name> <requires-assoc-array-name> [<platforms-assoc-array-name>] [<node-assoc-array-name>]
#
# Populates the caller-provided array names (via nameref) from the manifest
# file. Caller must declare them first (any prior contents are cleared). The
# 6th (platforms) and 7th (node) array names are OPTIONAL — omitting either
# preserves the original 5-arg call signature verbatim for existing callers.
# Returns 1 (and prints an error) if the manifest file is missing.
#
# RESILIENT-1535: `enabled` lines may also carry a `node=NAME,NAME,...`
# token (comma-separated hostnames). Omitted means "any node" — the
# implicit default every pre-existing line carries, so nothing regresses.
# This is distinct from `platforms=` (which scopes by OS/supervisor): `node=`
# scopes an organ to the specific owned machine(s) it is installed on (e.g.
# CJ's chump-cj-worker.service, or chump-postgrest.service which per
# RESILIENT-1057 only ever runs on the gap-substrate's host) so a hub node
# that merely LACKS that organ's node-local binary/file does not report it
# as an unexplained dark organ (see organ_dark_cause below).
