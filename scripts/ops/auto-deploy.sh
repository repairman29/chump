# scripts/ops/auto-deploy.sh — MISSION-012
#
# Auto-deploy daemon: ensures the installed /opt/homebrew/bin/chump binary
# tracks origin/main.  Called by the com.chump.auto-deploy launchd agent
# every 1200s (~20 min).
#
# Logic:
#   (a) git fetch origin main                             — get latest remote state
#   (b) compare origin/main HEAD SHA to stored last-deployed SHA
#   (c) if advanced → delegate to refresh-runner-binary.sh (isolated build)
#   (d) verify the PATH-resolved worker binary (not TARGET_BIN) matches
#       origin/main HEAD — on mismatch, emit binary_auto_deploy_failed
#       reason=worker_binary_sha_mismatch and exit non-zero (RESILIENT-408)
#   (e) on success → record new deployed SHA
#   (f) emit ambient kind=binary_auto_deployed
#
# Build isolation guarantee: this script NEVER checks out main or modifies the
# main worktree.  All building is delegated to refresh-runner-binary.sh which
# creates an isolated detached git worktree in /tmp, builds, installs, then
# tears it down.  The main checkout's local state is untouched.
#
# Idempotent: exits 0 (no-op) when the installed binary is already current.
#
# RESILIENT-211: canary rollout. This script's own local install (the
# machine it runs on — the launchd-scheduled canary node) is step 1 of a
# two-step SEQUENTIAL rollout across Chump's two-node fleet (Helsinki +
# closetjunky, see docs/process/ADD_A_FLEET_NODE.md). After the local
# rebuild+install succeeds, a health-check gate (mission-scoreboard.sh, or
# `chump health --slo-check` as fallback) must pass on THIS node before the
# second node is told to refresh. A failed gate BLOCKS the second-node
# rollout and emits kind=canary_rollout_failed rather than propagating a bad
# binary silently. No new environment tier is introduced — both nodes are
# existing production nodes; this only sequences and gates between them.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   CHUMP_REPO_ROOT               — repo root (default: resolved relative to script)
#   CHUMP_REFRESH_RUNNER_SCRIPT   — path to refresh-runner-binary.sh
#   CHUMP_SKIP_AUTO_DEPLOY        — set 1 to exit 0 immediately (bypass)
#   CHUMP_HEALTHCHECK_CMD        — override the canary health-check command
#                                   (full shell command string; used by tests
#                                   and operators to force pass/fail). Default:
#                                   scripts/dev/mission-scoreboard.sh, falling
#                                   back to `<TARGET_BIN> health --slo-check`.
#   CHUMP_SECOND_NODE_SSH         — ssh target (alias or user@host) for the
#                                   second fleet node. Unset = no second node
#                                   configured on this box; second-node deploy
#                                   is skipped (not a failure — single-node
#                                   contexts, e.g. dev checkouts, are fine).
#   CHUMP_SECOND_NODE_REFRESH_CMD — remote command run over ssh to refresh the
#                                   second node's binary (default: invokes
#                                   node-refresh-chump.sh on that node).
#   CHUMP_SECOND_NODE_DEPLOY_CMD  — full override for the entire second-node
#                                   deploy step (local shell command, no ssh).
#                                   Used by tests to assert propagation
#                                   happened/didn't without real network I/O.
#   CHUMP_WORKER_BIN              — RESILIENT-408: override for the
#                                   PATH-resolved binary workers actually
#                                   exec (test hook). Default resolution:
#                                   ~/.cargo/bin/chump if present, else
#                                   `command -v chump`, else TARGET_BIN.
#
# RESILIENT-211/RESILIENT-408 note: TARGET_BIN (CHUMP_RUNNER_BIN) is the
# install target this script *writes*. It is not necessarily the binary the
# fleet workers *execute* — workers resolve `chump` off PATH, and
# ~/.cargo/bin comes first there. Gating deploy success on TARGET_BIN alone
# let auto-deploy report success while the running worker kept executing a
# stale ~/.cargo/bin/chump (observed 2026-08-24, RESILIENT-408). Deploy
# success is therefore gated on the PATH-resolved binary, verified below.
