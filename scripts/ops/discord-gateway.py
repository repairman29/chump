"""discord-gateway.py — RESILIENT-266 serenity-free Discord receive gateway.

Opens an OUTBOUND WebSocket to Discord's gateway (no inbound endpoint, no domain,
no TLS to terminate, no serenity → sidesteps SECURITY-004's vulnerable rustls-webpki).
Receives operator DMs + button-click interactions and acts on them, replying via the
Discord REST API (the same path notify-operator.sh already uses).

This is the RECEIVE half of Chump<->operator Discord. The SEND half is
scripts/coord/lib/notify-operator.sh (bash+curl). Together = two-way.

Env:
  DISCORD_TOKEN            bot token (required)
  CHUMP_READY_DM_USER_ID   the ONLY user whose DMs/buttons are honored (required)
  CHUMP_REPO               repo root for status/exec commands (default cwd)
  CHUMP_DISCORD_GW_INTENTS override the intents bitfield (default DIRECT_MESSAGES)

Command surface (DM the bot):
  status | brief   → fleet ship-rate + recent merges
  ping             → pong (liveness)
  help             → this list
Button interactions:
  * "mergepr:<owner>/<repo>/<n>" / "rejectpr:<owner>/<repo>/<n>" — RESILIENT-265
    approve-from-phone: WIRED. The tap runs scripts/ops/pr-approval-action.sh
    (idempotent gh merge/close) and edits the message with the result. Only the
    operator (CHUMP_READY_DM_USER_ID) can act.
  * legacy "approve:<id>" / "deny:<id>" — acknowledged only (no action bound).
