# reaper-heartbeat-watchdog.sh — Detect when a stale-* reaper has stopped
# running and ALERT the fleet via ambient.jsonl.
#
# INFRA-120 (2026-05-01): the three reapers (stale-pr, stale-worktree,
# stale-branch) each run on their own launchd cadence. If the launchd plist
# isn't installed, or its job silently fails (broken PATH, dead python3, etc.),
# nothing alerts the fleet. Worktrees and branches accumulate for days before
# anyone notices. This watchdog grades the heartbeat files written by
# scripts/lib/reaper-instrumentation.sh and emits ALERT events so the staleness
# is visible in the standard pre-flight `tail -30 .chump-locks/ambient.jsonl`.
#
# Per-reaper cadence (the launchd plists configure these; numbers below match):
#
#   pr        | StartInterval 3600s   (1h)  → ALERT if no heartbeat in 4h
#   worktree  | StartInterval 3600s   (1h)  → ALERT if no heartbeat in 4h
#   branch    | StartInterval 86400s (24h)  → ALERT if no heartbeat in 48h
#
# Multipliers default to 4x cadence (worktree, branch) and 2x for the
# faster-cadence pr reaper, matching the gap acceptance criteria.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ops/reaper-heartbeat-watchdog.sh                    # check all reapers
#   scripts/ops/reaper-heartbeat-watchdog.sh pr worktree        # subset
#   scripts/ops/reaper-heartbeat-watchdog.sh --quiet            # ALERT only on failure
#
# Cron / launchd: install via scripts/setup/install-reaper-watchdog-launchd.sh
# (runs every 30 min). The watchdog itself is fail-closed: if it can't write
# to ambient.jsonl, it prints to stderr and exits non-zero so the launchd
# stderr log captures the issue.

# INFRA-452: include 'watchdog' in default TARGETS so the watchdog also
# grades ITSELF. The for-loop reads the heartbeat BEFORE reaper_finish
# stamps a fresh one at exit, so the read reflects the *previous* run —
# which is exactly the gap we want to detect (the canary died with the
# canaries it was supposed to grade).
# INFRA-683: added pr-watch and distill as non-reaper heartbeat targets.
# RESILIENT-246: added curator-supervisor. The curator is chump's
# product-management layer (pillar balance, PR unstick, backlog restock) and it
# died on ~2026-08-01 with launchd exit 78, unnoticed for twelve days, because
# nothing graded it. It is graded HERE rather than by a new bespoke watchdog:
# scripts/ops/curator-supervisor-run.sh calls reaper_setup/reaper_finish, so it
# stamps /tmp/chump-reaper-curator-supervisor.heartbeat on the standard path
# this loop already reads. No new mechanism, one new name.
# RESILIENT-256: added `wip`. The uncommitted-WIP watchdog is the only thing
# standing between a 13-hour-old dirty tree and a permanent loss, so a silent
# one is worse than a noisy one — it grades here like every other canary.
# INFRA-3650: added `process-organ-heal`. It heals raw background bash
# procs (e.g. almanac-vision-keeper) that aren't systemd units, so nothing
# else revives them if it dies — same "the healer can never stay dead"
# closure RESILIENT-356 gave organ-watchdog.sh, one layer down the stack.
# INFRA-3654: added `outcome-verify-heal-consumer`. It is the consumer for
# kind=outcome_probe_failed / kind=ac_coverage_proof_miss — both emitters
# existed with no consumer before this gap, so a dead consumer here would
# quietly reopen the same "proved-false live outcome, nobody told" hole.
