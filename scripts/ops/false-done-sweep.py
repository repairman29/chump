"""false-done-sweep — find DONE gaps whose closing PR never touched their scope.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY audit-done DOES NOT COVER IT

`chump gap audit-done` (INFRA-3495) already sweeps closed gaps, but it asks a
different question — "did the PR's diff cover the acceptance bullets?" — and it
cannot see the failure this catches, for two reasons:

  1. BOILERPLATE AC DEFEATS IT. `chump gap reserve` auto-generates acceptance
     criteria of the form "The change described by <title> is implemented in the
     relevant code path(s)." Scoring a diff against that sentence is not a test
     of anything. In the live run on 2026-08-10, nearly every bullet audit-done
     flagged was one of the three auto-generated boilerplate lines.

  2. IT ONLY EVER LOOKS AT AN ALPHABETICAL PREFIX. `GapStore::list` is
     `ORDER BY id` and `audit()` does `.take(limit)` with limit=100 hardcoded at
     the call site. So it re-audits COG-* and CREDIBLE-0xx on every run and has
     never examined the other 1,520 of 1,608 done-with-PR gaps (94.5%). Nothing
     schedules it either.

THE SIGNAL THIS USES INSTEAD

CREDIBLE-175 was proven a false done not by acceptance-bullet scoring but by
set arithmetic a person could do by eye: the gap's text names concrete repo
paths, and the closing PR's diff touched none of them. #3552 changed
.env.example, uncommitted-wip-watchdog.sh, install-wip-watchdog-launchd.sh,
src/git_safety.rs and tests/git_safety_e2e.rs. The gap was about
scripts/git-hooks/pre-push. Disjoint. The clinching receipt was
`git log -S nextest -- scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` returning empty: the work had
never landed in any commit, ever.

The closing mechanism is auto-flip-on-merge marking done every gap a PR merely
CITES (CREDIBLE-268). So the damage concentrates in PRs that closed several
gaps at once — which is the cheap prefilter this offers via --multi-close-only.

HONEST LIMITS — read before believing an output

  - This flags SUSPECTS, not verdicts. A gap can legitimately name a path the
    fix did not need to touch (a doc-only follow-up, a revert, a config change).
    Every flag needs the two-minute human check the report prints.
  - It can only judge gaps whose text names at least one concrete path. Gaps
    written purely in prose are reported separately as UNJUDGEABLE rather than
    silently counted as clean — absence of a path is not evidence of health.
  - A PR file list that cannot be fetched is reported as FETCH-FAILED, never as
    passing. Same rule.
  - MEASURED NEGATIVE CONTROL (2026-08-10): path-overlap alone does NOT catch
    CREDIBLE-175, the very case that motivated this. Its text names the exact
    files #3552 touched (src/git_safety.rs, tests/git_safety_e2e.rs, the WIP
    watchdog and its installer), so the overlap test calls it clean. Treat the
    SUSPECT tier as a triage queue with a real false-negative rate, not a
    detector. The BOOKKEEPING tier below is the one with teeth.

THE TIER THAT ACTUALLY HAS TEETH

A closing PR whose diff contains NO implementation files at all — only
docs/gaps/*.yaml, docs/audits/*, docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/archive/* — cannot have
shipped the work it is credited with. That is not a heuristic, it is set
membership. First run over the 47 multi-close PRs: 6 such PRs, closing 79 gaps
(3 P0, 23 P1, 52 P2, 1 P3). What this proves is that the closed_pr ATTRIBUTION
is false; whether the work landed in some OTHER PR still needs the per-gap
check, because a bookkeeping PR can legitimately record work done elsewhere.
Either way the registry's receipt points at a diff that does not contain it.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/ops/false-done-sweep.py --multi-close-only      # cheapest, highest yield
  python3 scripts/ops/false-done-sweep.py --all --limit 400       # broader
  python3 scripts/ops/false-done-sweep.py --gap CREDIBLE-175      # check one
  python3 scripts/ops/false-done-sweep.py --multi-close-only --json
Exit 0 always unless --strict, which exits 1 when any suspect is found.
