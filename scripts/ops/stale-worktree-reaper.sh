# stale-worktree-reaper.sh — Auto-remove linked worktrees whose branches have
# already merged to main (or had their remote branch deleted).
#
# Cousin to stale-pr-reaper.sh. That one closes orphaned PRs; this one cleans
# up orphaned worktrees on disk. Sessions can pile up 5-10+ linked worktrees
# under .claude/worktrees/ over a single dogfood day. Most of them have already
# shipped their gap and are dead weight: they slow down `git worktree list`,
# clutter `git status` for sibling agents, and confuse new sessions about what
# work is in flight.
#
# What it does (per worktree under .claude/worktrees/ and /tmp/chump-*):
#   1. Find its branch.
#   2. Mark REAPABLE if EITHER:
#        - the branch's tip is an ancestor of origin/main (squash-merged or
#          fast-forwarded — work is on main), OR
#        - origin has no ref for the branch any more (PR closed/merged and
#          GitHub auto-deleted the head branch).
#      For /tmp/chump-<gap-id>/ worktrees, ALSO reapable if:
#        - The gap extracted from dirname has status=done in state.db, OR
#        - The matching PR is MERGED or CLOSED (checked via GitHub cache).
#   3. SKIP if any of:
#        - any active lease in .chump-locks/*.json names this worktree
#        - the merged-age is below --age-min hours (default 1h cooldown so
#          we don't reap a worktree the agent is still cleaning up)
#        - any process has cwd inside the worktree or has a file open under
#          it (lsof +D check) — prevents reaping while a background sweep
#          is still writing. (INFRA-WORKTREE-REAPER-FIX, EVAL-026c data loss)
#        - any file under <worktree>/logs/ has been modified within
#          --log-fresh-min minutes (default 10) — heuristic for live writers
#          that lsof might miss (e.g. burst writers between samples)
#   4. For each reapable worktree, archive logs/ab/*.summary.json and
#      logs/ab/*.jsonl into docs/archive/eval-runs/<branch>-YYYY-MM-DD/,
#      then `git worktree remove --force <path>` (for git-linked worktrees)
#      or `rm -rf <path>` (for bare /tmp/chump-* directories not git-linked).
#
# Scan paths (INFRA-2020):
#   Default: WORKTREE_SCAN_PATHS=".claude/worktrees /tmp/chump-*"
#   Override via env: WORKTREE_SCAN_PATHS="/custom/path /other/path-*"
#   The git-worktree walk (via `git worktree list --porcelain`) still handles
#   .claude/worktrees/ (which are proper git linked worktrees). The /tmp/chump-*
#   pass handles the chump claim convention worktrees directly.
#
# INFRA-2339: Broadened scan — two new discovery paths beyond /tmp/chump-*:
#   1. ANY git-registered worktree whose path starts with /tmp/ is now included
#      via the git-worktree-list walk (scan_source=git-list). Catches orphans
#      like /tmp/infra-2446-fix (7.8 Gi) and /tmp/ship-068 (6.3 Gi) that were
#      invisible to the old /tmp/chump-* glob filter.
#   2. Standalone (non-git-registered) /tmp/ directories older than 12h that
#      match common rescue patterns (infra-NNNN-*, ship-NNN, fix-*, *-rescue,
#      *-fix) are enumerated by enumerate_tmp_rescue_orphans() and flagged
#      (scan_source=rescue-pattern or scan_source=tmp-age).
#   The existing SKIP heuristics (lsof, log-freshness, lease, age) are unchanged.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ops/stale-worktree-reaper.sh              # default: --dry-run
#   ./scripts/ops/stale-worktree-reaper.sh --dry-run    # explicit dry-run

#   ./scripts/ops/stale-worktree-reaper.sh --log-fresh-min 30      # require 30min log quiet
#   ./scripts/ops/stale-worktree-reaper.sh --force-skip-process-check  # EMERGENCY override
#
# Cron (launchd):
#   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.chump.stale-worktree-reaper.plist
#   wraps `bash -lc "$REPO/scripts/ops/stale-worktree-reaper.sh --execute"` with
#   StartInterval 3600. See scripts/setup/install-stale-worktree-reaper-launchd.sh.
#
# Disable temporarily:

# Bypass per-worktree:

#
# INFRA-2020: /tmp/chump-* support (disk_critical source — 43GB recovered manually)
#   WORKTREE_SCAN_PATHS env var controls which directories are walked.
#   Default includes both .claude/worktrees and /tmp/chump-* to cover the
#   chump claim convention (creates /tmp/chump-<gap-id>/ directories).
