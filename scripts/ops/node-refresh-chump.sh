# scripts/ops/node-refresh-chump.sh — RESILIENT-200
#
# Linux-node counterpart of scripts/setup/refresh-runner-binary.sh (which is the
# macOS launchd auto-deploy path). Keeps a fleet node's installed `chump` binary
# current with origin/main by rebuilding from a local mirror checkout and
# installing to the node's chump path.
#
# WHY a separate script: refresh-runner-binary.sh hardcodes macOS assumptions —
# /opt/homebrew/bin target, codesign-before-swap (syspolicyd), aarch64 cargo
# paths. The Linux fleet nodes (closetjunky, Helsinki) have none of those: no
# codesign, x86_64, and a per-user ~/.local/bin (or root /usr/local/bin) target.
# This script is the Linux-shaped equivalent, driven by a systemd --user timer
# (see scripts/setup/install-node-refresh-systemd.sh).
#
# PAUSE SAFETY (RESILIENT-073): this script ONLY refreshes the binary. It never
# reads, writes, or bumps ~/.chump/AUTONOMY_LEVEL, and never starts fleet work.
# A paused node (AUTONOMY_LEVEL=0) stays paused across refreshes — the binary
# gets current, the fleet stays off until the operator flips the switch.
#
# Idempotent: if the installed binary's build SHA already matches the
# green-main pointer, skips the rebuild entirely (fast no-op, no cargo
# invocation).
#
# BUILD-SPEED (INFRA-3677): when the binary IS out of date, this script first
# tries to PULL the prebuilt binary that free GH-hosted CI already built for the
# green-main commit (.github/workflows/build-fleet-binaries.yml → per-SHA
# artifact), installing it in seconds instead of a ~30-min local cargo build. It
# falls back to a local `cargo build --release --bin chump` only when no artifact
# exists for the SHA (gh unavailable, unknown arch, integrity/version mismatch),
# so a node is never worse off — just faster when the artifact is there.
#
# Emits (appended to $NODE_AMBIENT if it exists, else logfile only):
#   node_binary_refreshed         — successful rebuild + install
#   node_binary_refresh_skipped   — binary already current (no-op)
#   node_binary_refresh_failed    — build or install error
#
# Bypass: CHUMP_SKIP_NODE_REFRESH=1 short-circuits to exit 0.
#
# GREEN-MAIN PIN (RESILIENT-327): this script does NOT advance the live node
# to raw origin/main HEAD. It advances to the last commit that passed the
# full CI gate (the "green-main pointer"), found the same way
# scripts/coord/blame-bot.sh finds its baseline: most-recent SUCCESS run of
# the required workflow on branch main. A bad HEAD (red main) never reaches
# the live node — the node just stays pinned at the last-known-green sha
# until CI goes green again. Workers that branch off this node's mirror
# checkout therefore branch off the pinned green base, not a shifting HEAD.
#
# Env overrides:
#   CHUMP_NODE_REPO   repo mirror to build from   (default: first of
#                     ~/chump-host, ~/Projects/Chump, ~/chump that exists)
#   CHUMP_NODE_BIN    install destination         (default: ~/.local/bin/chump)
#   NODE_AMBIENT      ambient stream to append to (default: <repo>/.chump-locks/ambient.jsonl)
#   CHUMP_NODE_REFRESH_CI_WORKFLOW      required-gate workflow file (default: ci.yml)
#   CHUMP_NODE_REFRESH_GREEN_LOOKBACK   runs to scan for the green sha (default: 30)
#   CHUMP_NODE_REFRESH_TEST_GREEN_SHA   test injection: skip gh lookup, use this sha

# --- RESILIENT-1040: ensure gh is authenticated in THIS context -------------
# ROOT CAUSE of the 5-gap self-sustain saga (1036-1039): this script is
# launched by a systemd --user timer with no interactive login shell and no
# inherited `gh auth login` session. Without GH_TOKEN in the environment, gh
# is installed but NOT authed here — every gh call below (_find_green_main_sha,
# _try_artifact_pull, _find_build_artifact_sha) silently returns empty, which
# looks exactly like "gh unavailable" and falls through to a cold local cargo
# build EVERY cycle. RESILIENT-1037's nearest-ancestor sha logic was correct
# all along; it never got a chance to run because gh had no credentials.
# Fix: export GH_TOKEN from ~/.chump/providers.env (the fleet's canonical
# secret store, RESILIENT-173) before any gh call, same pattern already used
# by chump-node-install.sh for authenticated clones. A node that already has
# GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN in its environment (e.g. operator export, systemd
# Environment=) is left alone — providers.env is a fallback, not an override.

# executed a STALE ~/.cargo/bin/chump — 5 days behind origin/main — and drained
# the gap queue on old code. The refresh "ran" but did not do its job.

# on mugman: HEAD lacked a merged organ fix an hour after merge, self-reap
# never activated, because this script only ever deployed the BINARY and (on
# helsinki only) the ATC roster's systemd units — never the role's organ set
# (worker.sh etc.) that chump-node-install.sh --role <role> materializes.
# `--reconcile-organs-only` (added alongside this fix) skips the slow
# clone/creds/binary/substrate/eyes phases and just re-writes + restarts the
# role-scoped organs from the mirror this script just fast-forwarded — so
# "merged" reaches "running" for organs, not just for the chump binary.
#
# CHUMP_NODE_ROLE selects which organ set to converge (default: muscle, the
# class of node — mugman, cuphead — this gap was filed against). Best-effort:
# a failure here must never fail the binary refresh that already succeeded.

# --- RESILIENT-1037: nearest-ancestor artifact discovery ---------------------
# build-fleet-binaries.yml only triggers on push-to-main when the diff touches
# `paths:` that can change the binary (src/**, crates/**, build.rs, Cargo.*).
# The green-main pointer (found below by _find_green_main_sha, keyed off
# ci.yml which runs on EVERY push) has no such filter — a doc-only /
# state.sql-only commit (the recurring "chore(backlog): coherence sync" ships
# this repo produces constantly) advances green-main to a SHA that never had a
# build-fleet-binaries run at all. An exact-sha artifact lookup against that
# pointer always misses ("no green-main sha found"-adjacent symptom: the pull
# path degrades to a local cargo build every cycle even though CI already
# built an identical binary for the last source-changing ancestor commit),
# which is unsafe on a 2-core node (VERIFIED live on mugman: 4 cargo procs).
#
# Fix: instead of asking "is there a build for THIS exact sha", ask "what is
# the newest sha, reachable as an ancestor of (or equal to) this ref, that DID
# get a successful build-fleet-binaries run" — since no buildable path changed
# between that ancestor and the ref (or build-fleet-binaries would have fired
# on every intervening commit too), the binary content is identical and safe
# to pull + install under the ref's tree.
#
# Prints the found sha, or empty when gh is unavailable / no candidate run is
