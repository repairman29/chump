# scripts/ops/organ-watchdog.sh — INFRA-3595, self-deploy loop INFRA-3598
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Operator directive: the board must NOT hand-restart ATC
# organs (no helicopter parenting). Today none self-heals: chump-sla-scorecard
# .service failed on 2026-08-11 with nothing to bring it back. The systemd
# failure mode here is specifically start-limit-hit — a oneshot unit fired by
# a timer that fails a few times in a row trips systemd's default
# StartLimitBurst, and the unit sits `failed (Result: start-limit-hit)`
# forever: every subsequent timer fire is silently refused until something
# runs `systemctl reset-failed <unit>`. This watchdog is that something.
#
# INFRA-3598: INFRA-3593's merge->deploy path was false-done. node-refresh-
# chump.sh calls `install-helsinki-atc.sh --auto` to reinstall changed
# chump-*.service/.timer files, but node-refresh-chump.sh runs as a systemd
# --user timer (unprivileged) — --auto always hit the "not root, can't write
# /etc/systemd/system" branch and silently no-op'd. Merged unit-file fixes
# (e.g. the INFRA-3595 scorecard fix) never reached the live unit. This
# watchdog already runs as root on a 5-minute cadence (see
# chump-organ-watchdog.service), so it is the first place in the whole chain
# that can actually perform the privileged reinstall. Every cycle now also:
#   0. (opt-in, CHUMP_ORGAN_WATCHDOG_CLONE_REFRESH=1) fast-forwards
#      CHUMP_REPO_ROOT to origin/main so the tracked unit files it reconciles
#      against are never stale (AC 5).
#   0.5. calls `install-helsinki-atc.sh --auto`, which diffs tracked
#      scripts/dispatch/chump-*.service|.timer against what's live and
#      reinstalls + restarts anything changed, emitting
#      kind=organ_units_deployed (AC 1, 3, 7).
#
# Algorithm, every cycle:
#   1. List every chump-*.service unit systemd knows about.
#   2. For each one whose ActiveState=failed: `systemctl reset-failed <unit>`
#      then `systemctl restart <unit>` (oneshots) — clears the start-limit
#      latch and re-fires the unit immediately rather than waiting for the
#      next timer tick.
#   3. Do the same for chump-*.timer units that are enabled but inactive
#      (a timer can itself be disabled by a failed daemon-reload elsewhere).
#   3b. (RESILIENT-413) Re-anchor chump-*.timer units that are ACTIVE but
#      scheduled to fire NEVER (NextElapse=infinity, a self-chaining
#      OnUnitActiveSec timer that lost its anchor on daemon-reload) or whose
#      LastTrigger has drifted older than 3x their interval — the silent-dark
#      blind spot that steps 1 and 2 both miss (Result=success, still active).
#   4. Emit kind=organ_self_healed per unit healed (observable proof of
#      self-heal, no human step) and kind=organ_watchdog_tick every run
#      (heartbeat, mirrors main-health-watchdog's success-path emit) so a
#      dead watchdog is itself visible via the standard reaper-heartbeat
#      pattern.
#   5. (opt-in, CHUMP_ORGAN_WATCHDOG_BINARY_HEAL=1 — INFRA-3651, PEER-HEAL-04)
#      detect a vanished/stale release binary (no target/release/chump, or
#      its build sha older than origin/main HEAD) and trigger a rebuild via
#      node-refresh-chump.sh, emitting kind=organ_binary_healed; separately,
#      detect the binary-refresh organ itself (chump-node-refresh.service —
#      a systemd --user unit, RESILIENT-200, invisible to section 1's
#      system-scope scan) sitting failed, and revive it: systemd --user
#      reset-failed+restart, falling back to a direct process-path re-run of
#      the refresh wrapper if the --user instance can't be reached.

# ── 2b. Active-but-UNSCHEDULED / stale chump-*.timer units (RESILIENT-413) ──
# THE SILENT-DARK BLIND SPOT. Section 2 only re-arms a timer that went
# *inactive*. A far nastier failure keeps the timer `active` yet scheduled to
# fire NEVER: a self-chaining monotonic timer (OnUnitActiveSec=) loses its
# activation anchor on a daemon-reload or unit re-create, so NextElapse resolves
# to `infinity` — the unit sits ActiveState=active/SubState=elapsed with
# Result=success, invisible to both section 1 (not failed) and section 2 (not
# inactive). It simply rots. Confirmed dark this way 2026-08: chump-gap-closure-
# reconcile (last fired Aug 21) and chump-rot-reaper (last Aug 22, anchor
# drifted weeks out). A merged unit-file fix (e.g. #4310's OnCalendar
# conversion) that was never reloaded into the running systemd generation
# presents identically — the on-disk file is correct but the in-memory timer is
# still wedged at infinity — and this section re-anchors it too.
#
# Detection uses two robust signals, either of which fires a re-anchor:
#   (A) NextElapseUSecMonotonic=infinity AND no realtime elapse  -> unscheduled.
#   (B) LastTriggerUSec older than 3x the timer's own interval    -> stale
#       (catches anchor-DRIFT where next elapse is finite but absurdly far out).
# Re-anchor = `systemctl daemon-reload` (once per cycle, so an on-disk unit
# fix — e.g. #4310's OnCalendar conversion — that was merged but never reloaded
# into the running systemd generation is picked up) then `systemctl restart
# <timer>` (recompute NextElapse from the reloaded unit; for an OnCalendar timer
# this yields a durable finite next, and Persistent=true replays the run missed
# while the timer was dark). Emits organ_timer_reanchored.
#
# We deliberately do NOT `systemctl start <service>` here: (1) it BLOCKS on a
# Type=oneshot service until it completes, serializing/hanging the whole watchdog
# cycle behind a slow organ; (2) starting chump-organ-watchdog.service would
# RECURSE into a nested watchdog run; and (3) empirically it does not durably
# re-anchor a oneshot OnUnitActiveSec timer anyway — the timer snaps straight
# back to infinity. daemon-reload + restart-timer avoids all three, and the
# real durable fix for a chronically-wedging monotonic timer is converting its
# unit to OnCalendar (the belt; see chump-rot-reaper.timer et al.), which cannot
# anchor-drift — this section is the suspenders that catches any straggler.
#
# Guards: only ACTIVE, enabled timers (inactive ones are section 2's job);
# skip-listed timers (CHUMP_ORGAN_WATCHDOG_TIMER_EXCLUDE, default chump-farmer.timer

# left alone; a timer whose service is in organ-reconcile's backoff registry is

# heartbeat-based fleet-worker-watchdog (a spinning worker updates its
# heartbeat every cycle — the silent-worker detector is blind to it). The OS
# emitted the worker_stuck signal 108x and NOTHING consumed it. This section
# is the safety net: it detects a worker spinning on preflight_fail from the
# ambient stream and auto-heals it — restart the worker unit + clear the
# offending stale claim so the picker advances past it. Layers A+B in
# worker.sh/_pick_and_claim_gap.py make the spin structurally impossible at
# the root; this is defence-in-depth for a worker running older code or an
# edge case the picker can't see.

# as section 3 — a dev/laptop node has no worker units to restart).

# binary-currency promise (RESILIENT-200 / node-refresh-chump.sh):
#   (a) the release binary itself vanished or went stale — no
#       target/release/chump, or its build sha lags origin/main HEAD
#       (refresh-runner-binary.sh's own staleness rule, reused here so this
#       watchdog agrees with the refresher on what "current" means).
#   (b) the organ that's supposed to prevent (a), chump-node-refresh.service,
#       is itself dead. It is a systemd --user unit (RESILIENT-200) —
#       invisible to section 1's system-scope `systemctl list-units` scan.
#       That blind spot is exactly how it sat `failed` for 11 days unnoticed.
#
# Known gap (AC 5): reviving the --user unit from a root watchdog needs a
# resolvable XDG_RUNTIME_DIR for the unit's owning user. When systemd --user
# can't be reached (non-lingering user, no active session), the systemd path
# errors and this section falls through to the process path — a direct
# re-run of the refresh wrapper that doesn't depend on systemd at all, so the
# binary still gets current even when the unit itself can't be revived.
