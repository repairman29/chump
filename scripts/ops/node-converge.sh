# scripts/ops/node-converge.sh — RESILIENT-1189
#
# The NODE AUTO-CONVERGE organ. Keeps a fleet node's SOURCE checkout current
# with origin/main on a cadence, so a merged fix actually REACHES the iron —
# closing the "merged != deployed" loop for the whole class of BASH organs that
# a binary refresh can never deploy.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the #1 systemic wound, confirmed live):
#   Nothing on the fleet converges the SOURCE checkout the organs run out of.
#   The one script that came close — scripts/ops/node-refresh-chump.sh — has a
#   binary-SHA idempotency short-circuit (RESILIENT-200): when the installed
#   `chump` binary already matches green-main it `exit 0`s BEFORE the
#   converge_mirror_hard_reset. A merged BASH-only fix (e.g. the rot-reaper fix
#   #4637, or any scripts/ops/*.sh / scripts/coord/*.sh edit) never bumps the
#   binary SHA, so node-refresh treats the node as "already current" and skips
#   the source reset entirely — the checkout stays days stale, and every organ
#   whose systemd ExecStart is `bash scripts/…/foo.sh` keeps running the OLD
#   script straight out of the stale tree. CJ's /home/jeff/Projects/chump had to
#   be hand `git reset --hard`'d to break exactly this.
#
# THE FIX — an UNCONDITIONAL, lightweight, gh-auth-INDEPENDENT source converge:
#   This organ does ONE thing on a ~10-min cadence: fetch origin/main and
#   `converge_mirror_hard_reset origin/main` (the RESILIENT-001 primitive) so
#   the working tree is byte-for-byte origin/main. It never builds, never pins
#   to green-main, never calls gh — a public-repo fetch needs no auth, and the
#   whole point is that this path can NEVER silently degrade the way
#   node-refresh's gh-dependent green-lookup does (RESILIENT-1040/1041). Once the
#   source is converged, the EXISTING organs do the rest: a bash organ's next
#   timer firing runs the new script straight from the converged tree, and any
#   changed *.service/.timer UNIT files are installed by the separate
#   chump-organ-deploy.timer / chump-organ-reconcile.timer. This organ is only
#   the missing FIRST hop — get the source current — that everything downstream
#   already assumed was happening.
#
# RELATION TO node-refresh-chump.sh (extend, don't duplicate): that script owns
#   the BINARY (build/pull/install + green-main pin); this organ owns the SOURCE
#   TREE. They converge to almost the same ref through the SAME shared primitive
#   (converge_mirror_hard_reset), so they cannot race to different states — and
#   this organ's unconditional reset covers the exact case node-refresh skips
#   (bash-only merges that leave the binary SHA unchanged).
#
# SAFETY (active-worker-safe by construction):
#   * Resets ONLY the main checkout ($REPO_ROOT). Workers build gaps in LINKED
#     git worktrees under .claude/worktrees/* — those have their own HEAD and
#     working tree, so a `git reset --hard` in the main checkout does not touch
#     them; and .claude/worktrees/ is gitignored, so the reset never sees it as
#     a collision to overwrite either. A worker's in-flight gap is untouched.
#   * converge_mirror_hard_reset is a `git reset --hard`, never a `git clean -x`,
#     so gitignored runtime state survives: .chump/state.db (+ -wal/-shm),
#     .chump-locks/, .claude/worktrees/, per-worktree target dirs. A live DB
#     write is not corrupted.
#   * DEFERS (clean skip, no reset) if a rebase / merge / cherry-pick / bisect is
#     in progress in the main checkout — never yanks the tree out from under an
#     operator or another organ mid-operation. It just tries again next tick.
#   * Idempotent: a tree already at origin/main is a no-op (node_converge_skipped).
#
# Emits (appended to $NODE_AMBIENT if its dir exists, else logfile only):
#   node_converged          — the checkout was behind and is now at origin/main
#   node_converge_skipped   — already current / no repo / operation-in-progress
#   node_converge_failed    — fetch-then-reset failed (tree left as-is)
#
# Env overrides:
#   CHUMP_NODE_REPO   source checkout to converge (default: first of
#                     ~/chump-host, ~/Projects/Chump, ~/chump that is a git repo)
#   NODE_AMBIENT      ambient stream to append to (default: <repo>/.chump-locks/ambient.jsonl)
#   CHUMP_NODE_CONVERGE_REF   ref to converge to (default: origin/main; test hook)
#   CHUMP_NODE_CONVERGE_REMOTE / CHUMP_NODE_CONVERGE_BRANCH
#                     remote + branch to fetch (default: origin / main)
#
# NOTE: this organ deliberately adds NO skip/bypass env var (the bypass-var debt
# ceiling is capped, INFRA-3625). If a node must not converge, disable the timer.

# RESILIENT-1453: restart a running worker whose worker.sh changed under it.
# This organ hard-resets the SOURCE tree to origin/main, but the long-running

# in-flight gap (the "merged != running" disease). This organ already runs on a
# ~10min timer with passwordless sudo, so it is the right place to bounce the
# worker EXTERNALLY the instant the tracked worker.sh content changes. The worker
# handles SIGTERM with a WIP checkpoint (INFRA-686), so an external restart is safe
# at any point. Host-agnostic: discovers the active chump-node*-worker.service unit
# rather than hard-coding node1.
