# process-organ-heal.sh — INFRA-3650 (PEER-HEAL-03, MISSION-010).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. scripts/ops/organ-watchdog.sh + organ-reconcile.sh already
# self-heal chump-*.service/.timer SYSTEMD units (INFRA-3595, RESILIENT-305/
# 347). Nothing revives a raw background bash process that isn't wrapped as a
# systemd unit at all — an "unsupervised bash proc" started by hand (or by an
# installer that never wired in real supervision) just dies silently, and
# systemd's own Restart=always doesn't apply because the process was never a
# unit in the first place. scripts/ops/almanac-vision-keeper.sh (the "eyes")
# is the first concrete instance of this: a standing loop, not a systemd
# unit. This heal loop is the muscle that revives it (and anything else
# declared in process-organ-registry.txt) — one pgrep + respawn pass per
# invocation, install-time-wired so it lands on every owned node via
# chump-node-install.sh instead of being a hand-op.
#
# DEPTH (wiring/liveness tier, per this gap's AC5):
#   - WIRING tier: this script + almanac-vision-keeper.sh + the registry +
#     chump-node-install.sh ORGANS wiring + the reaper-heartbeat-watchdog.sh
#     TARGETS entry are all shipped and locally CI-tested
#     (scripts/ci/test-process-organ-heal.sh) in this PR.
#   - LIVE tier (pgrep on closetjunky itself, ambient.jsonl tail on CJ):
#     CONFIRMED 2026-08-22 — this session's worktree turned out to be running
#     ON closetjunky itself (hostname check), so scripts/ops/
#     check-process-organ-heal-live.sh could run directly: systemd timer
#     active, organ_watchdog_tick fresh, almanac-vision-keeper running.
#     Earlier sessions (and this one, before checking hostname) found no
#     credential path to CJ from a *remote* Claude Code session — ssh,
#     `tailscale ssh`, and a `tailscale nc` ProxyCommand all hit publickey
#     Permission denied, and no self-hosted runner is registered on CJ — so
#     that path stays valid for any future session that is NOT itself CJ.
#     Full findings + the live-check's own discovery-path bug (also fixed in
#     this PR): docs/process/PROCEDURES/verify-process-organ-heal-live.md.
