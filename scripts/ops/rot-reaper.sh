# rot-reaper.sh — the NO-ABANDON JANITOR: drive EVERY open fleet PR toward a
# terminal state so nothing can rot (RESILIENT-311 / RESILIENT-324).
#
# THE GUARANTEE (RESILIENT-311, operator law "one way or the other, this queue
# stays managed"): on every beat, each open fleet-authored PR is pushed toward a
# terminal state (MERGED, or CLOSED+requeued) within a bounded time. No PR sits
# abandoned. The classes this organ drives:
#   • CONFLICTING beyond CONFLICT age +
#     conflict-resolution EXHAUSTED         → close + requeue + label rot-reaped
#   • CONFLICTING but resolution NOT yet
#     exhausted (savable)                   → hand off to consumer + DEFER [339]
#   • MERGEABLE but a REQUIRED check has
#     FAILED beyond REALFAIL age           → close + requeue + label rot-reaped
#   • MERGEABLE + green + UNARMED beyond
#     ARM age (minutes)                    → arm auto-merge (backstop the lander)
#   • BEHIND                               → left for chump-armed-rebaser
#   • fresh anything                       → left (owner/CI still working)
# Plus a NO-ABANDON METRIC each beat (kind=pr_no_abandon_backlog): the count of
# open PRs older than the deadline still in a non-terminal state. Target 0.
#
# WHY the label (RESILIENT-311, 2026-08-15 reap/revive deadlock): the rot-reaper
# was closing CONFLICTING PR #3792 every 30 min AND requeuing its gap to `open`
# — but post-push-integrity-watch.sh (a reviver that reopens closed-not-merged
# fleet PRs) saw "closed PR + open gap" as "work lost, reopen it" and reopened
# the dead, unmergeable branch within ~60s. The reaper's close never STUCK: an
# infinite reap↔revive fight, and the PR rotted OPEN forever. The reaper's
# filters were never the problem — its close was being undone. Fix: every reaper
# close now stamps a `rot-reaped` label; revivers skip any PR bearing it (an
# intentional terminal close is not a lost-work incident — a fresh PR comes from
# the requeued gap). The label makes the close terminal.
#
# WHY (operator, 2026-08-14 deadlock): the back-pressure controller
# (scripts/ops/back-pressure-controller.sh) HALTS production when the "stuck
# pile" (open PRs that are BLOCKED or DIRTY) hits HALT_AT (6). It RESUMES when
# the pile drains below RESUME_AT (3). The armed-rebaser
# (scripts/coord/armed-pr-rebaser.sh) drains the pile by rebasing PRs that are
# BEHIND — but it CANNOT resolve a real merge CONFLICT. So when the jam is
# mostly CONFLICTING PRs, the rebaser drains the pile partway (to 4–5), it
# lands in the 3–6 hysteresis dead-zone, and the fleet stays HALTED forever
# with no auto-recovery. That is exactly what deadlocked the fleet for hours.
#
# This organ is the missing drain: it CLOSES open PRs that are truly
# CONFLICTING and old enough that they are never going to auto-rebase, and
# RE-QUEUES their gap so the fleet re-does the work cleanly on fresh main. A
# CONFLICTING PR represents work that must be redone anyway (the branch and
# main diverged in the same lines); reaping it loses nothing and unblocks the
# breaker.
#
# What it does, per open PR authored by the fleet:
#   1. Skip filing PRs ("chore(gaps): file/reserve …") — never self-close.
#   2. Only act when mergeable == "CONFLICTING". BLOCKED-but-MERGEABLE PRs are
#      NOT touched — those just need CI/approval, not reaping (the pr-lander /
#      ci-flake-rerun organs handle them).
#   3. Age gate: only close PRs older than MIN_AGE_HOURS (default 4h). A fresh
#      conflict may still be actively rebased by its owner; never reap it.
#   4. Re-queue each cited gap: if its status is not already `open` and not
#      `done`, `chump gap set --status open` + an audit note. If the gap is
#      already `done` (a stale DUPLICATE PR whose work landed elsewhere), do
#      NOT try to reopen it — the recycled-ID guard blocks that and it would
#      be wrong anyway; just close the PR.
#   5. Close the PR with an explanatory comment.
#
# Idempotent (a PR it closes leaves the open set; the gap note is tagged),
# logged, and dry-run-able. Safe to run on a timer.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ops/rot-reaper.sh              # live run
#   ./scripts/ops/rot-reaper.sh --dry-run    # print what would happen, no changes
#
# Environment:
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_MIN_AGE_HOURS  min PR age (hours) before a CONFLICTING PR
#                                   can be reaped (default 4). Excludes fresh
#                                   conflicts.
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_REALFAIL_AGE_HOURS  min PR age (hours) before a MERGEABLE
#                                   PR that is failing a REQUIRED check can be
#                                   reaped (default 8). Longer than the conflict
#                                   gate: a red check may be a transient flake a
#                                   rerun clears, so give the fix/rerun organs
#                                   more room before declaring the work lost.
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_ARM_AGE_MIN    min PR age (minutes) before a green-but-
#                                   UNARMED PR is armed as a backstop to the
#                                   pr-lander (default 15).
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_MAX            safety cap: max PRs to close per run
#                                   (default 10). Prevents a runaway mass-close.
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_LABEL          terminal-close label (default rot-reaped).
#                                   Revivers skip any PR bearing it.
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_RESPAWN_CAP    EFFECTIVE-434: max times a gap may be
#                                   auto-closed+re-queued before the reaper
#                                   stops re-queuing it and escalates to the
#                                   operator instead (default 3). The PR still
#                                   gets closed either way; only the automatic
#                                   respawn stops. Prevents a genuinely-buggy
#                                   PR from recycling forever.
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_REQUIRED_CHECKS  comma-separated override of the required-
#                                   check set (default: fetched from branch
#                                   protection, fallback to the known 4).
#   CHUMP_ROT_REAPER_CONFLICT_STATE_DIR  RESILIENT-339 resolve-first: dir the
#                                   conflict-resolution-consumer records per-PR

#                                   <repo>/.chump-locks/conflict-resolution-attempts).
#                                   A CONFLICTING PR is reaped ONLY once its state
#                                   here shows attempts >= CHUMP_CONFLICT_CONSUMER_MAX_ATTEMPTS
#                                   or an escalation — i.e. resolution was tried
#                                   and genuinely failed. No state = still savable
#                                   = handed off + deferred, never discarded.

# A CONFLICTING PR is reaped ONLY after the standing conflict-resolution-consumer
# (scripts/coord/conflict-resolution-consumer.sh, RESILIENT-301) has ALREADY
# tried to rebase-resolve it onto the base (its union / append-only merge drivers
# dissolve the hot-file collisions) AND declared the conflict genuinely
# unresolvable — its per-PR attempt counter hit CHUMP_CONFLICT_CONSUMER_MAX_ATTEMPTS
# or it escalated to the operator. Until then the PR is still savable, so the
# reaper HANDS IT OFF (emits the armed_pr_needs_conflict_resolution signal the
# consumer drains) and DEFERS the reap. Net: a PR is only ever MERGED (the
# consumer's push lands it) or sent-to-rework — never discarded while resolution
# is still possible.
