#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ops/pr-approval-action.sh — RESILIENT-265 "approve-from-phone".
#
# THE ACTION half of the Discord PR-approval flow. Given an operator decision
# (merge or reject) for one OS-authored product-repo PR, this script does the
# real GitHub work idempotently and prints a single human-readable status line
# (the text the gateway edits the Discord message to). It is the ONE codepath a
# real "✅ Merge" / "❌ Reject" tap triggers, so it is independently testable:
#   scripts/ops/discord-gateway.py shells out to it on INTERACTION_CREATE, and
#   the proof harness invokes it directly with the same arguments.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT (not inline in the gateway): keeping the mutation in one
# bash entrypoint means the gateway stays thin, and the exact action a tap
# performs can be dry-run or exercised against a throwaway PR without faking a
# Discord interaction. Mirrors how notify-operator.sh is the reusable SEND half.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   pr-approval-action.sh <merge|reject> <owner/repo> <number> [--dry-run]
#     → prints ONE status line to stdout (safe to drop straight into Discord)
#     → exit 0 on success OR idempotent no-op (already merged/closed)
#     → exit 1 on a real error (bad args, gh failure on an actionable PR)
#
# IDEMPOTENCY IS LOAD-BEARING. A second tap on an already-acted PR must be a
# no-op with a clear message, never a double-merge. Before acting we read live
# PR state: MERGED → "already merged", CLOSED → "already closed/rejected", and
# only an OPEN PR is actually merged/closed. This is the human-in-the-loop
# guarantee: the button is safe to double-tap.
#
# MERGE METHOD: honors the repo's allowed methods (squash > merge > rebase),
# defaulting to --squash when permitted. Override with CHUMP_PR_MERGE_METHOD.
#
# SAFETY: never auto-merges anything on its own — it only runs when explicitly
# invoked with a decision (by a real operator tap, or the proof harness). It
# does not scan, poll, or decide; it executes one already-made decision.
