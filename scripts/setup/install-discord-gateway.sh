#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-discord-gateway.sh — RESILIENT-266: run the Discord gateway as a
# managed daemon so Chump can RECEIVE replies and button taps.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Chump can already send: src/discord_dm.rs is plain
# REST and needs no bot (proven live 2026-08-09). It cannot receive: the shipped
# binary is built with `--cfg feature="default"` and `default = []`, so the
# `discord` feature (and its serenity dependency) is compiled OUT, and no
# gateway process runs. src/discord.rs is otherwise COMPLETE — gateway bot with
# DIRECT_MESSAGES intent, owner verification at :932/:964/:999, and
# interaction_create at :1210 already parsing chump_approve:<id> /
# chump_deny:<id> into approval_resolver. This is a build-and-run gap, not a
# feature gap.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/setup/install-discord-gateway.sh            # build, install, load
#   bash scripts/setup/install-discord-gateway.sh --no-build # install/load only
#   bash scripts/setup/install-discord-gateway.sh --uninstall
