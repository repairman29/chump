# ── RESILIENT-246: the binary MUST live at a stable path ───────────────────
# The twelve-day outage happened because this script fell back to
# $REPO_ROOT/target/release/chump-curator-supervisor and baked that path into
# the plist. target/release is disposable (cargo clean, cargo-target-reaper,
# disk-pressure reaps). When it was reclaimed, launchd could not spawn the job
# and returned 78 (EX_CONFIG) forever — writing NOTHING to either log, because
# the failure happens before the process exists.
#
# Two defenses now:
#   1. The plist no longer references the binary at all (it runs /bin/bash +
#      scripts/ops/curator-supervisor-run.sh, which is version-controlled).
#   2. We still install the binary into ~/.cargo/bin — the stable location
#      where the fleet's other six daemons live and which nothing reaps — so
#      the runner's first-choice path is durable.
