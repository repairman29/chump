# install-wip-watchdog-launchd.sh — RESILIENT-256 (2026-08-09)
#
# Install the uncommitted-WIP watchdog LaunchAgent. Runs every 5 minutes;
# snapshots any checkout whose uncommitted work has gone idle past the
# threshold into refs/wip/… (object store), and ALERTs into ambient.jsonl.
#
# 5 minutes, not 30, and the threshold is 15 MINUTES, not 3 hours. The old
# pairing only ever caught ABANDONED work — "idle" is measured from the newest
# mtime among dirty files, so anything actively being edited had an age near
# zero and was never snapshotted. What protects a live session is a threshold
# short enough that ordinary pauses checkpoint you.
#
# This cadence is only affordable because snapshots now dedup by tree hash and
# prune to CHUMP_WIP_RETAIN per branch. Without those, idle work minted a fresh
# anchored ref every single run.
#
# Exactly the shape of scripts/setup/install-reaper-watchdog-launchd.sh
# (dev.chump.reaper-watchdog), so the fleet has one launchd pattern, not two.
#
# Idempotent. After install:
#   launchctl list | grep dev.chump.wip-watchdog
#
# To disable:
#   launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.chump.wip-watchdog.plist

set -euo pipefail

# Resolve to the *main* worktree so the plist's absolute path survives
# worktree reaping (same reason as INFRA-451).
