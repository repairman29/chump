# install-sccache.sh — INFRA-202: shared compilation cache for fleet worktrees.
# INFRA-3660: activated for CJ WORKERS (not just the pre-push probe), cache
# lives on LOCAL disk only — a USB-mounted data drive on Ubuntu CJ, never a
# cloud/R2 path. See docs/process/SCCACHE_R2_CACHE.md for the separate,
# opt-in CI+R2 remote-cache path — that is NOT what this script wires.
#
# Each linked worktree under .claude/worktrees/ has its own target/ dir.
# Without a shared compilation cache, every fresh worktree pays a 5-15 min
# cold-build cost when bot-merge.sh runs cargo check / clippy / test. With
# sccache as a rustc wrapper, the rustc invocations are cached at the
# crate-compilation level — second worktree to build a given crate version
# gets it from cache in seconds.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Install sccache — `cargo install sccache` on Linux (Ubuntu CJ has no
#      brew), `brew install sccache` on macOS. Idempotent — skips if present.
#   2. Write .cargo/config.toml with rustc-wrapper=sccache + a LOCAL cache
#      dir (prefers a mounted external/USB data disk over the root disk so
#      the cache doesn't compete with the OS drive for space — INFRA-3660
#      found cjdata1 full at its 13G target while cjdata3 had 13G free).
#      mold / cranelift are only written into the config when the machine
#      actually has them, so a host missing either can't get a broken build.
#   3. Verify with `cargo check --bin chump` and report cache hit rate.
#
# Run this once per machine. .cargo/config.toml is .gitignored so each
# machine controls its own cache config — feel free to tune the cache size
# or disable by removing the file.
