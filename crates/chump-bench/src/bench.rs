//! ChumpBench runner — DOC-072 / EFFECTIVE-327.
//!
//! Runs a **track** (a repo + a plain-language task + a known-good acceptance check) as one
//! scoreable lap: optionally drive the track's mode engine, grade the acceptance check, tally
//! the human touches during the lap (the CREDIBLE-171 zero-touch metric), and print a scorecard.
//! The scorecard's human-touches-per-lap, trended across the suite, is the readiness number —
//! not CI-green, not a merged PR, but a course completed with no one reaching in.
//!
//! v1 scope: the schema + the grading/scoring harness + `ci-green` grading, proven on the
//! known-good RESCUE/BEAST lap. Engine-drive (`--apply`) shells the mode engine; other
//! acceptance kinds and ambient-event emission are honest follow-ups.
