//! The three concrete contracts called out by INFRA-1720 AC #3.
//!
//! These are *real* contract shapes — i.e. when (not if) we rewrite the
//! current markdown-prompt subagent spawn sites in `src/agent_factory.rs`
//! and the auto-decompose path, these are the types they'll use.
//!
//! Each contract:
//!
//! * Has `Input`/`Output` structs with `#[derive]` for serde.
//! * Implements [`crate::Validate`] on `Output` (semantic checks beyond schema).
//! * Implements [`crate::HandoffContract`] with a `prompt()` template that
//!   tells the subagent the exact JSON shape it must emit.
//! * Picks a `model_tier` appropriate to the work.

Base branch     : {base_branch}       (the PR the fleet opens will target this)

Proposed change:
{proposed_gap_description}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MERGE BAR — your PR MUST satisfy ALL of the following or it
will NOT be merged (EFFECTIVE-215 / CREDIBLE-096).
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Gate 1 — CI green
  The external repo's CI must be GREEN on your PR head commit.
  Every non-advisory check-run on the head SHA must be SUCCESS
  (or NEUTRAL/SKIPPED for intentional opt-outs).  A single
  failing check-run → HELD(ci).  Zero check-runs → HELD(no-gates).

Gate 2 — Anti-cosmetic: a test that FAILS on base and PASSES on head
  This is the decisive gate.  Your PR diff MUST add or modify at
  least one test file (heuristic: path contains `test`/`spec`, or
  filename matches `*_test.*`, `test_*.*`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`,
  `__tests__/*`, etc.).  That test MUST:
    • FAIL (non-zero exit) when run against the BASE commit, AND
    • PASS (exit 0) when run against your HEAD commit.

  A test that also passes on the base commit proves nothing —
  HELD(unproven).  A PR with no changed test file at all →
  HELD(cosmetic).

  Therefore: identify a concrete, testable behavioral defect or
  missing behavior your change addresses, write a test that
  demonstrably FAILS before your change and PASSES after, and
  include it.  If the proposed change is pure config/docs with no
  testable behavior, reframe it as the underlying behavioral defect
  and prove THAT with a test — do NOT open an unprovable PR.

Gate 3 — No regression
  The repo's FULL existing test suite MUST pass on your head commit.
  If the repo's CI already runs the full test suite (Gate 1 covers
  this), Gate 3 is satisfied by CI.  If CI only lints or builds,
  run the full test suite locally on the head commit.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SELF-VERIFY — run ALL three checks BEFORE opening the PR:
  1. Checkout the BASE commit; run your changed test → must FAIL.
  2. Checkout your HEAD commit; run your changed test → must PASS.
  3. Run the FULL test suite on HEAD → must be GREEN.
  Only open the PR if all three hold.  If any check is wrong,
  fix the implementation or the test before pushing.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Steps — EDIT ONLY, no git:
1. Work in {repo_local_path} on the current branch. Do NOT create or switch branches, and
   do NOT `git commit`, `git push`, or `gh pr create` — the fleet performs the commit,
   push, and PR deterministically after you finish (this is why your change ships reliably
   instead of depending on you to run git correctly).
2. Identify the behavioral defect or missing behavior, and write a test for it.
3. Confirm the test FAILS on the base commit.
4. Implement the change that makes the test pass. HOW TO EDIT: use `str_replace`
   (read the file first, copy the EXACT snippet to change into `old_string` with its
   indentation, put the corrected text in `new_string` — it must match exactly once).
   Do NOT rewrite an entire existing file with `write_file` — that truncates/clobbers
   large files and the ship guard will reject it. `write_file` is ONLY for creating a
   brand-new file.
5. Confirm the test PASSES and the full suite is GREEN with your change.
6. Leave EVERY change UNCOMMITTED in the working tree, then stop and briefly summarize:
   what you changed, which test proves it, and your self-verify result (failed on base,
   passed on head, full suite green).

If you cannot satisfy the MERGE BAR, make NO changes and say why — an empty working tree
is an honest outcome the fleet will report; a fabricated or unprovable change is not."#,

Candidate gap IDs (land all of these, or bisect-quarantine those that break CI):
```json
{candidates_json}
```

Steps:
1. Verify the integration branch exists and is clean.
2. Cherry-pick / merge each candidate in order, running CI after each batch.
3. If CI breaks, bisect to find the culprit gap(s) and quarantine them.
4. Record the final commit SHA for each gap that landed.
5. Emit a single fenced JSON block with this exact shape (no other JSON, no extra
   commentary outside the block):

```json
{{
  "cycle_status": "Shipped" | "BisectQuarantined" | "Inconclusive" | "Aborted",
  "manifest": [
    {{ "gap_id": "<gap-id>", "commit_sha": "<40-char SHA>" }},

  "quarantined_gap_ids": ["<gap-id>", ...],
  "root_cause_signature": "<short failure description>" | null,
  "bisect_runs": <integer>
}}
```

Conservation law (HARD CONSTRAINT):
  manifest.len() + quarantined_gap_ids.len() MUST equal {candidate_count}
  (the total number of candidates). Every candidate must appear in exactly one
  of the two lists — no silent drops.

Rules:
- `cycle_status` MUST be one of: Shipped, BisectQuarantined, Inconclusive, Aborted.
- Each `manifest` entry needs a real 40-char commit SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
- `quarantined_gap_ids` is empty when `cycle_status` is `Shipped`.
- `root_cause_signature` is null unless bisect identified a specific root cause.
- `bisect_runs` is 0 if no bisect was needed.

{intent_doc}

Instructions:
1. Read the intent document carefully. Identify the key product themes / pillars
   / effort bands (depending on "Group by" above).
2. Propose up to {max_gaps} gaps total, clustered into groups. Fewer is fine if
   the document doesn't justify more.
3. For each gap:
   - Write a concrete, imperative `title` (< 100 chars, no TODO placeholders).
   - Write a one-paragraph `description` that a Chump worker can act on cold.
   - Choose `priority` (P0 | P1 | P2 | P3). Reserve P0 for genuine unblockers.
   - Choose `effort` (xs | s | m | l | xl).
   - Write at least one concrete, non-placeholder `acceptance_criteria` entry.
     Each criterion must be a full sentence describing a verifiable outcome.
     Do NOT write "TODO", "TBD", or "<fill in>" — these will be rejected.
   - List `depends_on` as intra-roadmap titles OR filed gap IDs (<DOMAIN>-<NUM>).
     Use an empty list if there are no prerequisites.
4. Write a 2-4 sentence `narrative` summarising the overall roadmap arc.
5. Set `confidence` in [0.0, 1.0]: 1.0 means the intent doc was unambiguous;
   0.0 means you are guessing — prefer low confidence + a good narrative over
   hallucinating a confident plan.

Emit a SINGLE fenced JSON block (no other JSON, no commentary outside the block):

```json
{{
  "groups": [
    {{
      "name": "<theme / pillar / effort band>",
      "rationale": "<why these gaps belong together>",

- Every `acceptance_criteria` must be non-empty and contain no TODO/TBD placeholders.
- Total gaps across all groups must not exceed {max_gaps}.

Product intent: {intent}

Choose the primary language, framework, test harness, and core dependencies that
best fit this intent. Prefer well-tested, production-ready choices. For systems-level
or performance-critical work, prefer Rust. For data/ML work, prefer Python.
For web/API work with a small team, prefer TypeScript or Python.

Rules:
- `language` MUST be a single lowercase string (no version numbers).
- `framework` SHOULD be a well-known framework for the chosen language; use `"minimal"` if none applies.
- `deps` MAY be empty if no core libraries are needed at project creation.
- `rationale` MUST explain why this architecture fits the stated intent specifically.

Problem statement (their words):
