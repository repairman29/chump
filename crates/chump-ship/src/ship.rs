//! Ship trait + typed envelope/receipt/error surface (INFRA-2001 Phase 2).
//!
//! This module defines the **executor-side API** for the chump ship
//! pipeline. The planner in [`crate`] root decides WHAT to do; this
//! module defines the contract for DOING it.
//!
//! ## Why a trait
//!
//! `scripts/coord/bot-merge.sh` (3044 LOC of bash) handles three flavours
//! of ship under one roof:
//!
//! 1. **Manual ship**  — agent has finished work, push branch + open PR +
//!    arm auto-merge. The "happy path" — ~80% of fleet ships go this way.
//! 2. **Bot-merge ship** — autonomous mode, may retry/rebase/conflict-recover
//!    across multiple rounds. ~15% of ships.
//! 3. **Stack-on ship** — like Manual but with `--base=<prev-PR-head>`.
//!    ~5% of ships (related work that would file-conflict otherwise).
//!
//! Hiding all three behind a `Ship` trait gives us:
//!
//! - **Per-mode tests** without a giant bash script under test.
//! - **A typed receipt** ([`ShipReceipt`]) instead of parsing stdout.
//! - **A typed error** ([`ShipError`]) with the failure class baked in,
//!   not regex'd out of `gh` stderr.
//! - **Single-instance guarantees by construction** — see
//!   [`crate::manual_ship::ManualShipPath`] which uses a PID-locked
//!   Unix socket and returns [`ShipError::BotMergeDoubleInstance`] on
//!   collision (the INFRA-1532 fix that was previously enforced by
//!   ad-hoc bash convention).
//!
//! ## Phase 1 scope
//!
//! - Trait + types only here (this file).
//! - **One** concrete impl ([`crate::manual_ship::ManualShipPath`]) —
//!   the happy-path manual ship.
//! - [`crate::bot_merge::BotMergePath`] is **STUBBED** — `ship()` returns
//!   [`ShipError::BotMergeDoubleInstance`] with a "Phase 1: not
//!   implemented" diagnostic. Phase 2 sub-gap will port the bash body.
//!
//! Phase 1 does NOT emit any new ambient event kinds.
