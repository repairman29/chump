# ACP Agent Capability Comparison

This table benchmarks Chump against every agent in the [JetBrains ACP Agent Registry](https://jetbrains.com/acp) plus well-known open-source ACP implementations. Cells link to source documentation; cells marked **⚠️ verify** should be spot-checked at next audit because the registry is live and data can drift.

**Freshness:** audited 2026-05-13. Re-audit filed as META-051 (due 2026-08-13). To update a cell, edit this file and bump `last_audited`. Re-audit tracked in META-062.

## Comparison Axes

| Axis | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **V1 methods** | Initialize, session/new, session/load, session/list, session/prompt, session/update, terminal/* methods |
| **V2 methods** | V2 additions: session/set\_mode, session/set\_config\_option, session/list\_permissions, session/clear\_permission, session/cancel |
| **V2.1 middleware** | session/request\_permission (outbound RPC for tool-call consent) wired into request handling |
| **Sticky permissions** | session/list\_permissions + session/clear\_permission: sticky decisions survive across turns; optionally serialized across restarts |
| **Cross-process sessions** | session/load reconstitutes sessions from a prior process via disk persistence |
| **Modes** | Semantic (work/research/light) vs UI-label-only (fast/deep) distinction |
| **Skills** | Exposes a skills/procedure library discoverable via `skills: true` capability flag |
| **Thinking stream** | Emits `Thinking` events for model reasoning tokens (Qwen3 `<think>`, Claude extended thinking) separately from AgentMessageDelta |
| **Mixed-content prompts** | session/prompt accepts text + image + resource content blocks in a single message |
| **Terminal lifecycle** | terminal/create → terminal/output → terminal/wait\_for\_exit → terminal/kill → terminal/release |
| **mcpServers passthrough** | Records client-declared MCP server config on session; manages lifecycle |

## Re-audit Process

This document should be re-audited quarterly. The gap META-062 tracks the next due date (2026-08-13).

Re-audit checklist:
1. Visit [JetBrains ACP Agent Registry](https://jetbrains.com/acp) — add any new agents
2. For each agent, check their docs for ACP-specific changelogs
3. Update cells and bump `last_audited` date
4. Update `re_audit_due` to three months from the new `last_audited`
5. Comment on META-062 with a link to the PR
