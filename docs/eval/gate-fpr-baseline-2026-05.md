# CI Gate False-Positive Rate Baseline — 2026-05

**Gap:** EVAL-124
**Date:** 2026-05-13T19:10:02Z
**PRs analyzed:** 30 most-recently merged PRs
**Method:** Automated script applying simplified gate logic to PR metadata and file lists via GitHub REST API. Note: full gate scripts need git context; this is an approximation. See CREDIBLE-048 for production telemetry.

## Summary

| Gate | PRs | Fires | Fire rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| check-pr-scope.sh | 30 | 0 | 0.0% | Rule A=0 C=0 |
| check-mass-deletion.sh | 30 | 0 | 0.0% | Rule A=0 B=0 |

**Overall fire rate:** 0.0% across both gates

## Interpretation

All fires where the PR merged without title/label changes are counted as FP candidates.
This baseline is for comparison with CREDIBLE-048 production telemetry, which will
give per-gate fire/TP/FP counts with operator-provided classifications.

## Calibration Update

Based on this baseline:
- **check-pr-scope.sh**: fire rate 0.0% — gate is appropriately calibrated (0 fires in last 30 PRs)
- **check-mass-deletion.sh**: fire rate 0.0% — gate is appropriately calibrated (0 fires in last 30 PRs)

See [docs/process/PR_HYGIENE.md](../process/PR_HYGIENE.md) for the calibration table.
