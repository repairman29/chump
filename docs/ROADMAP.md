## TL;DR for a returning operator (2026-05-28 reality)

Five anchors. **Mission Yield** is the headline number; **Wave order** is the ship discipline; the three workstreams below run inside both constraints.

| Anchor | Doc | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **📊 Mission Yield (the rule of X)** | [strategy/MISSION_YIELD.md](strategy/MISSION_YIELD.md) | Is the work actually moving the product? Single number, weekly. |
| **⏯️ Wave order (ship discipline)** | [strategy/ROADMAP_WAVES.md](strategy/ROADMAP_WAVES.md) | What ships first to avoid rework? 4 waves, cumulative. |
| **🚀 50 PRs/hour push** | [strategy/ROADMAP_50_PER_HOUR.md](strategy/ROADMAP_50_PER_HOUR.md) | Capacity to sustain Mission Yield at scale. 15 days. |
| **👤 Marcus customer arc** | [strategy/ROADMAP_MARCUS.md](strategy/ROADMAP_MARCUS.md) | The customer the product is for. 5 milestones M-A → M-E. |
| **🛠️ Backlog decisions** | [strategy/ROADMAP_BACKLOG.md](strategy/ROADMAP_BACKLOG.md) | 8 design-conversation items decided 2026-05-16 — what's build/defer/fold. |
| **🔄 Integration-cycle ship pipeline** | [strategy/INTEGRATION_CYCLE_2026-05-29.md](strategy/INTEGRATION_CYCLE_2026-05-29.md) | How the fleet ships: batched cycles (Mode A) vs per-PR (Mode B) vs hot-fix (Mode C) vs external-repo (Mode D). |
| **🌍 Outward Flywheel (MISSION-050)** | [strategy/OUTWARD_FLYWHEEL_2026-06-22.md](strategy/OUTWARD_FLYWHEEL_2026-06-22.md) | The path to MISSION-010: improving *other* repos. Run outward to discover, fix foundation-first (3→2→1: substrate → outward-loop → work-mix). |
| **🏢 Run-the-Business track** | [strategy/RUN_THE_BUSINESS_2026-08-09.md](strategy/RUN_THE_BUSINESS_2026-08-09.md) | The co-equal non-build arm: maintenance, operations, and keeping existing systems running so the fleet isn't only pointed at new construction. |

**Read order:** Mission Yield first (the why), Waves second (the order), then the three workstreams (what's pickable now).

**Operating model:** the Chief of Staff role (currently Claude-as-COS; productized via [process/COS_OPERATING_MODEL.md](process/COS_OPERATING_MODEL.md) for autonomy by ~2026-07-01) opens every session with current Mission Yield, enforces the 30%-per-pillar cap, and produces a Sunday digest at [syntheses/cos-weekly-*.md](syntheses/). First digest: [cos-weekly-2026-05-17.md](syntheses/cos-weekly-2026-05-17.md) (Mission Yield baseline ~13.6/Mtok).

**Framing reset 2026-05-16:** Infra IS the product. GitHub is where users
live. "Offline-first" is a tier-3 differentiator, not the spine. The fleet's
behavior (reliable auto-merge, conflict-resolving rebases, healing CI gates)
IS what customers like Marcus pay for.

## The ChumpOS arc — the multi-cycle north star (2026-07-27)

> Chump is an **agentic operating system**: the coordination + governance layer
> that runs a fleet of swappable harnesses to turn problems into shipped tools,
> with the human at ring-0, not in the conductor's chair. The weekly cycles
> below execute *inside* this arc. Outcome: **CHUMPOS**. Done-state: anyone
> points it at a real problem, walks away, and gets a finished, honest tool.

**Proving-ground status (2026-08-03).** The V1→V3 ladder is tracked in
[DOC-074](strategy/CHUMPOS_V1_ROADMAP.md) against the ChumpBench proving ground.
Position: **honest V1, entering V1.5** — the judge is trustworthy (CREDIBLE-192/194/195:
a do-nothing PR now scores STUB, not "verify"), the reliability instrument is live
(CREDIBLE-190), and the first reliability fix is proven (EFFECTIVE-352: an agent flail
went 1909s→288s, ~6.6×, correctness held). Still needed for V1.5: a 3× consecutive
full-suite green streak + the 4 branch-proving tracks (decompose/acquire/escalate/page).

**How it's powered (two layers, both already live):** internal inference runs on
the free-provider cascade (`CHUMP_CASCADE_ENABLED`, gemini-biased for reasoning,
quality-tracked + auto-demoting); code-writing **workers** run on a swappable
harness (`CHUMP_AGENT_HARNESS`), with OpenCode as the model gateway (many models,
incl. subscription-backed) for the bulk and Claude reserved as the hard-ship
fallback. Harness-agnostic but governed: any harness that meets
[`HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`](process/HARNESS_CONTRACT.md) and *earns its place by
measured quality* runs; the contracts and gates do not move.

**The phases (pre-mortem-hardened — scaling is gated, not free):**

| Phase | Goal | Done / scoreboard | Umbrella |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Substrate & governance: Hetzner Linux host, ephemeral worktrees + one capped target + a disk-floor GATE (not six reapers), worker-scaling *formula*, usage ceiling, systemd daemon parity | disk flat, sub not exhausted, 7d unattended | **MISSION-065** |
| 1 | Prove hands-off: instrument + verify zero-touch, repeatable, on BEAST-MODE | ① verified YES | **MISSION-066** |
| 2 | Kernel ABI: design-time contract enforcement (A2A fires on invariant-reversal / privilege-spend / collision) — the #3331 lesson | cross-agent rework ↓ | **MISSION-067** |
| 3 | Break the self-referential loop → mission-ship ratio ≥ ⅔ **(the gate for scaling)** | ② ≥ ⅔ | decompose after P2 |
| 4 | Scale horizontally (integration trains, sharded CI, NATS, 2nd node) — only past the ⅔ gate | ④ ship rate | — |
| 5 | Self-heal: cold reboot restores the fleet, zero manual steps | Goal 2 | — |
| 6 | Userland: point freed capacity at real external tools | Goal 4 | — |
| 7 | Giveable: one-command install on commodity Linux + local-model lane | North Star | — |

**The spine:** Phases 0 and 3 are load-bearing — you earn the right to scale by
bounding the substrate and making the work mission-weighted; Phase 2 is the
unlock that makes both harness-agnosticism and scaling safe. This arc depends on
the anti-bloat keystone `signals are not work` (MISSION-045 — doctrine doc lands
with #3331; internal fleet health is telemetry, never a self-filed gap).

## Current cycle — Revival & Truth (2026-07-19 → 2026-08-16)

> Filed 2026-07-19 after the queue-clear + registry triage session (15 PRs merged,
> 288 pollution gaps closed, outcome linkage backfilled to 100% of open gaps,
> P0 refilled with 5 true unblockers, 85 dormant P1s demoted). Context: the fleet
> was silent June 22 → July 18 (auth-cache + lid-close class outages); trunk is
> green and the queue is empty. This cycle turns the machine back on WITHOUT
> re-inheriting the failure modes that killed it, then points it at the mission.

## Week 1 — Revive the heart, safely (Jul 19 → 26)

**Outcome.** The fleet ships autonomously again for 72h+ with no silent death:
merge queue alive, sleep/wake survivable, operator has a one-dial control, and
the scoreboard can no longer claim health it can't prove.

**Implementing gaps:**
- **RESILIENT-168** P0 — integrator-daemon dead (exit 127) → merge queue restored
- **RESILIENT-169** P0 — sleep/wake-recovery hook (lid-close killed the fleet twice)
- **EFFECTIVE-305** P0 — chump-mode one-dial run-mode toggle (grind/travel/off), durable port
- **CREDIBLE-151** P0 — mission scoreboard verifies installed-binary SHA vs origin/main (13-day-stale-binary incident)

## Week 2 — Registry truth (Jul 26 → Aug 2)

**Outcome.** state.db is trustworthy end-to-end: no ID collisions across
worktrees, no fixture leakage, workers attributable, vague-AC backlog burned down.

**Implementing gaps:**
- **INFRA-3338** P0 — dual-allocator gap-ID collision fix
- **CREDIBLE-152** P1 — reserve guard: fixture titles hard-blocked from canonical db
- **CREDIBLE-099** P1 — workers register THEMSELVES (heartbeats + kpi --agents attribution)

## Week 3 — Mission proof on BEAST (Aug 2 → 9)

**Outcome.** MISSION-010 stops being aspirational: the fleet runs an overnight
loop against repairman29/BEAST-MODE and lands real merged PRs there — the
scoreboard's own definition of proof.

**Implementing gaps:**
- **INFRA-2268** P1 — `chump onboard --schedule` per-external-repo overnight loop
- **INFRA-2269** P2 — `chump keys` per-org key vault (unblocks safe external-repo auth)

## Week 4 — Product surface (Aug 9 → 16)

**Outcome.** The parts a customer touches get real: monolith decomposed enough
to publish the root crate, TS bindings exist, and the operator gets a weekly
digest instead of reading ambient streams.

**Implementing gaps:**
- **INFRA-3287** P2 — main.rs god-switchboard decomposition (tiny slices; unblocks crates.io root publish)
- **INFRA-2270** P2 — `chump sdk gen --target ts`
- **PRODUCT-137** P2 — operator weekly digest (Discord/email)

## Fleet fabric — managing the machines ChumpOS runs on (2026-08-09)

> **Operator directive (Jeff, 2026-08-09).** We need to figure out how to
> **manage the hardware and various machines ChumpOS uses** — disk reaping on
> all of them, job distribution, the works — and the **Linux-node provisioning
> experience must be productized for COTG** once we figure it out.

**Why now.** Bringing `helsinki` (a free, always-on tailnet Linux box, currently
running only the NATS broker at 100% idle) online as a shipping node exposed that
we have *no machine-management fabric*. Everything we've hardened — disk reaping
(cargo-sweep GC ZERO-WASTE-053/054, RESILIENT-273 self-heal), the farmer auth
probe (the launchd-PATH class fixed 2026-08-09), token refresh (macOS-Keychain-only,
so a Linux node can't self-refresh) — is **Mac-singleton**. A second machine has
none of it, and provisioning one today is a bespoke, undocumented slog.

**The gap, concretely (helsinki audit 2026-08-09):** it's a *lapsed partial node* —
chump binary present but stale (0.2.0, Jul 23); `~/.chump/` has old `state.db` +
`AUTONOMY_LEVEL` + a `node-refresh-logs/` dir (someone already fought the
Linux-token problem); but **no node/npm** (claude CLI can't install), **`gh` not
authed** (can't push PRs), **no git checkout** (can't make worktrees), and **no
model auth** (the oauth refresh is Keychain-bound to the Mac).

**Two workstreams this seeds (file as gaps when picked up):**

1. **Machine fabric — RESILIENT/ZERO-WASTE.** A per-host agent + a machine
   registry so disk reaping, job/worker distribution (the NATS push-routing
   FLEET-034 already exists but runs no remote workers), auth/token sync, binary
   freshness, and health all run on *every* node, not just the Mac. The
   duty-officer design ([design/DUTY_OFFICER.md](design/DUTY_OFFICER.md),
   RESILIENT-274) is the natural owner — its playbook registry should be
   per-host, and its per-business instantiation is the same shape as per-machine.

2. **Linux-node provisioning → COTG product.** The "empty Linux box → shipping
   ChumpOS node" path must become a **repeatable, productized onboarding**
   (one command / documented SOP), because that *is* how a COTG customer stands
   up their own capacity. What we learn dragging helsinki across the line
   (token push-sync Mac→node, claude-CLI install, gh device-auth, checkout +
   binary bootstrap, farmer/worker wiring) is the first draft of that product.

**Prereqs already in hand:** NATS broker live on helsinki; push-routing
(FLEET-034) exists; disk-reaping + auth-probe fixes are Mac-proven and portable;
subscription-oauth chosen as the model-auth mode (operator, 2026-08-09).

## Today's bets (week of 2026-05-24)

| Bet | Gap(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Chump fleet autopilot — operator playbook as one daemon set | [META-090](gaps/META-090.yaml) P0/m | ✅ done — composes the 5 wizard-retirement daemons; reconciliation shipped via #2570 (RESILIENT-021) |
| Marcus arc M-B → M-C (post-demo trust + first-customer-onboard) | new gap TBD when M-B framing lands | **next operator decision** — defines this week's bet list. M-A (per-gap budgets INFRA-1486) shipped; M-B chump.fleet.yaml spec INFRA-1483 + multi-repo fan-out INFRA-1484 still open |
| 50-PRs/hr Phase 2 — sustained 4h verification | INFRA-1540/1542 instrumentation follow-up | shipped capacity; now needs the 4h-green run |
| A2A-first communication discipline (presence ledger + auto-mirror + passive emit) | [INFRA-1932](gaps/INFRA-1932.yaml) P1/m | ✅ done — partial-shipped via #2524 + later land closed the 6 follow-up ACs |
| Rust-first orchestration substrate (Wave-3) — port 16.8K LOC bash+Python to ~6K LOC Rust across 6 sub-gaps | [META-107](gaps/META-107.yaml) P1/xl umbrella + [INFRA-1997](gaps/INFRA-1997.yaml) P0/m keystone | ✅ done at umbrella level; cutover follow-ups INFRA-2060..2065 + META-120 filed for the 7–14d parallel-run validation window per blueprint [strategy/RUST_FIRST_MIGRATION_BLUEPRINT_2026-05-25.md](strategy/RUST_FIRST_MIGRATION_BLUEPRINT_2026-05-25.md) |

**Chained, not competing.** META-107 IS the substrate that META-090 composes. Without META-107, autopilot inherits 16.8K LOC of bash spaghetti (race conditions in `bot-merge.sh`, env-leak in `pre-push`, `sed`-escape in `broadcast.sh`). With it, autopilot is composed from `chump-ship` + `chump-messaging` + `chump-worker` Rust traits where env-leak / double-instance / SQL-escape bugs are *structurally impossible*.

### Wizard-retirement criteria — 5/5 ✅ shipped (META-090 unblock COMPLETE)

The wizard role retires when the daemon mesh covers what the operator does manually 10×/day. Criteria:

| # | Daemon | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | curator-jit-scheduler | ✅ shipped INFRA-1892 (PR #2463) |
| 2 | transient-retrigger | ✅ shipped INFRA-1899 (PR #2482) |
| 3 | pr-pulse consumer | ✅ shipped INFRA-1898 (PR #2497) |
| 4 | oracle-refresh cron | ✅ shipped META-088 (PR #2510); ongoing observability INFRA-2122 caught silent failures 2026-05-29 |
| 5 | curator-launch automation | ✅ shipped INFRA-1880 (PR #2518) |

All 5 shipped. META-090 autopilot is composing them (#2570). **The wizard role can retire when the operator validates the autopilot daemon-set runs 24h unattended** (Day +14 checkpoint).

The remaining substrate-quality work is OAuth refresh chain (INFRA-2124) + Oracle silent-failure detection (INFRA-2122 observability) — these don't block wizard-retirement but they make the autopilot loop reliable.

## Operator action checkpoints (refreshed 2026-05-28 — Wave 1 CI scaling shipped)

- **Day +1** (~2026-05-29): observe sccache R2 cache hit-rate climb on next 5–10 cargo-test CI runs (target ≥50% hit by Day +3); flip "Require merge queue" toggle in branch protection when comfortable (5-min Web UI flip, reversible in 30s; runbook in `process/MERGE_QUEUE.md`)
- **Day +3** (~2026-05-31): Wave 1 empirical measurement — compare cargo build wall-clock before/after on a representative wave of 5 PRs; document in commit body of follow-up gap
- **Day +7** (~2026-06-04): INFRA-1998 messaging + INFRA-1999 github-cache in parallel; 50/hr sustained 4h green with Wave 1 multipliers active
- **Day +14** (~2026-06-11): INFRA-2001 chump-ship lands (fixes INFRA-1532 double-instance by PID-locked socket, by construction); META-090 autopilot composition begins ON the Rust substrate
- **Day +21** (~2026-06-18): META-090 autopilot daemon-set running unattended for 24h on env-immune substrate; INFRA-2002 chump-worker lands
- **Day +28** (~2026-06-25): Marcus M-B demo with autopilot+substrate as the credibility story (post-trust-gate onboarding)

**The trade** (vs prior 2026-05-25 schedule): Wave 1 CI scaling shipped 3 days ahead of its implicit slot, compressing future bets by the same window. Tonight's INFRA-2096 keystone (5-bug trunk-RED cluster) hardened the registry plumbing as a side effect — the kind of incident the Rust substrate is designed to eliminate by construction, but observed-and-fixed-in-bash is a useful Wave-1 baseline.
