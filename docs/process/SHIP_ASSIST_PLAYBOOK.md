# Ship-Assist Playbook

> **Why this doc exists.** Today's loop session (2026-05-29) ran 17 cycles, queued 40 PRs at peak, drained back to 33 + 7 mine landed on main. Along the way it surfaced 7 distinct wedge classes that each blocked real ships, and demonstrated which tools work / which silently wedge / which don't exist yet. Future shepherds shouldn't re-discover all of this from scratch.

## 1. Wedge taxonomy (7 classes from today's incident chain)

Each class names the failure mode, the symptom you'll see, and the surgical fix shape. Pattern-14 evidence required before any "queue wedged" broadcast — never sound the alarm without rollup-level data from the failing PR.

### Class 1 — `fmt-drift` on main (queue-wide fast-checks wedge)
**Symptom.** Every Rust PR fails `fast-checks` with `cargo fmt --check` flagging files the PR didn't touch. The failure pattern is identical across PRs — they all inherit the same dirty state from main.
**Detection.** Drill into any failing `fast-checks` job log: look for `Diff in /path/to/file.rs:LINE`. If multiple PRs show the same diff list against files outside their own changeset, main has fmt drift.
**Fix.** Reserve a `fmt-sweep` gap, claim, `cargo fmt --all` in a clean worktree, commit, ship as P0/xs single-file PR. Auto-merge fires once it lands. Today's evidence: INFRA-2216 / PR #2782.
**Prevention.** `chump preflight` (INFRA-1670) catches before push; INFRA-2120 preflight-vs-CI parity ensures the gate exists locally. If both pass and CI still fails, that's a parity bug — file accordingly.

### Class 2 — `raw-gh-allowlist-miss` (queue-wide audit wedge)
**Symptom.** Every PR fails `audit` job on step `raw-gh lint gate — no new direct gh calls in hot-path scripts outside lib/ (INFRA-1274)`. Locally reproducible via `bash scripts/ci/test-no-raw-gh-in-hot-paths.sh`.
**Detection.** Drill into the audit job log → find the line `[raw-gh-lint] FAIL: ... scripts/path/foo.sh:LINE: gh pr list \`. That script needs to be in `scripts/ci/raw-gh-allowlist.txt` with a migration-gap reference.
**Fix.** One-line append to `raw-gh-allowlist.txt` with `# INFRA-NNNN: <reason>` comment. P0/xs ship. Today's evidence: INFRA-2218 / PR #2784.
**Prevention.** Pre-merge gate that flags new `scripts/ops|coord|dispatch/*.sh` files with raw gh calls — already in `test-no-raw-gh-in-hot-paths.sh`; tighten when a script lands without allowlist sibling.

### Class 3 — `sccache-R2-pair-mismatch` (queue-wide Rust wedge)
**Symptom.** Every Rust CI job (cargo-test, coverage, fast-checks via embedded pre-push gate) fails with `sccache: error: Server startup failed: cache storage failed to read: ... S3Error { code: "Unauthorized" }` followed by `cargo metadata exit 101`.
**Detection.** Two-step Pattern-14 evidence:
1. `gh secret list -R repairman29/chump | grep R2_` — confirm timestamps of `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. If they don't all share a recent timestamp (within minutes), the key+secret pair was half-rotated.
2. If timestamps look fine, the Cloudflare-side token may have been revoked OR the pasted value has a typo. Cloudflare R2 access key IDs are 32-char hex; secret access keys are 64-char hex. Length-mismatch = invalid value.
**Fix (primary, daily-driver).** `bash scripts/ops/rotate-sccache-r2-gh-only.sh --execute` after dropping new pair values into `~/.chump/r2-new-token.txt`. Atomic GH-secret update; INFRA-2240, shipped today.
**Fix (advanced backup).** `bash scripts/ops/rotate-sccache-r2-token.sh --execute` — also automates the CF dashboard regen via the CF API. Requires `CHUMP_CF_API_TOKEN` with `User API Tokens: Edit` scope. INFRA-2237, shipped today.
**Operator note.** R2 tokens are issued as a PAIR. If you regenerate, both halves get new strings — update BOTH in GH Secrets in one sitting. Half-rotation = 90 min queue wedge (today's incident).
**Prevention.** None at the GH layer today; CI step that verifies sccache health post-install before any cargo invocation would catch this — see INFRA-2184-class pattern.

### Class 4 — `bot-merge.sh` silent wedge
**Symptom.** `bot-merge.sh --gap X --auto-merge` runs >4 minutes with zero stdout/stderr output. Background task shows process is alive (PID in `S` state) but no network activity, no progress markers.
**Detection.** Watch the output file (`tasks/<id>.output`); if empty after 4 min, it's wedged.
**Fix.** Kill bot-merge processes, manual recovery:
```bash
git push -u origin <branch> --force-with-lease   # may need CHUMP_BYPASS_BOT_MERGE=1 + Bot-Merge-Bypass trailer
gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title ... --body ...
gh pr merge <N> --auto --squash
rm -f .chump-locks/claim-<gap>-*.json
```
Today's evidence: 3 occurrences (cycle 5, 6, 13 of today's loop). Trailer `Bot-Merge-Bypass: <reason>` in commit body documents intentional bypass for audit.
**Prevention.** `INFRA-1399` (bot-merge stall detection) — filed, not shipped. Wall-clock progress monitor with auto-bail after 5 min no-output would save ~15-20 min per wedge.

### Class 5 — Sonnet sub-agent stalls mid-task (~600s no progress)
**Symptom.** Sonnet sub-agent dispatched via Agent tool stops emitting tool calls after a long stretch — typically while debugging a smoke test or working through a complex AC. Stream watchdog kills it.
**Detection.** Task notification with `<status>failed</status>` and `Agent stalled: no progress for 600s`.
**Fix.** If the Sonnet had a worktree with uncommitted progress, **do NOT use `chump claim --force-recover`** to re-claim (Class 6 below). Instead:
1. Check `.chump-locks/` for the stalled lease — if expired, the system already cleaned it up
2. `cd /tmp/chump-<gap-id>` — see if the worktree still has WIP
3. If WIP exists: commit-as-WIP first, then ship/iterate from there
4. If WIP gone or too entangled: re-dispatch with explicit recovery notes from the prior attempt
**Today's evidence.** INFRA-2071 cycle-13 (Sonnet stalled at 7/8 smoke tests on a test-design bug; my recovery attempt wiped the work via `--force-recover`; documented in INFRA-2071 notes + INFRA-2235 follow-up).

### Class 6 — `chump claim --force-recover` wipes uncommitted state
**Symptom.** You see the error `worktree path already exists: /tmp/chump-X / Remove it first OR re-run with --force-recover to auto-clean`. You run `--force-recover`. Worktree gets destroyed including any uncommitted changes.
**Detection.** Too late — already happened. The lesson: don't auto-recover without checking for WIP first.
**Fix (prevention).** INFRA-2235 (filed 2026-05-29): `chump claim --force-recover` should refuse by default when target worktree has uncommitted changes; offer `--discard-wip` for legitimate destroy-state. Emits `kind=force_recover_wip_loss` audit event.
**Workaround (today).** Before re-running with `--force-recover`: `cd /tmp/chump-<gap>; git status; git stash` to preserve any WIP. Then `--force-recover`. Then re-apply the stash post-claim.

### Class 7 — gap-status auto-flip silently no-ops
**Symptom.** A PR merges to main with `INFRA-XXXX` in its subject line. The expected auto-flip via INFRA-2121 (auto-flip-on-merge action) doesn't fire. Gap stays `status: open` in state.db even though the work shipped.
**Detection.** `chump gap show INFRA-XXXX | grep status` — shows `open` despite verified merge. Today's evidence: 6 gaps in this state across cycles 7+10 (INFRA-2202, 2200, 2151, 2184, DOC-058, 2208).
**Fix (per-occurrence).** Manual flip: `CHUMP_GAP_SHIP_SKIP_STALE_CHECK=1 CHUMP_BYPASS_PROOF_OF_MERGE=1 chump gap ship INFRA-XXXX --closed-pr <N> --update-yaml`.
**Fix (root cause).** INFRA-2230 (filed 2026-05-29): diagnose why INFRA-2121 silently misses certain PR/gap pairs. Add `kind=auto_flip_skipped` ambient with reason field (regex_miss / workflow_skip / state_db_error). Either fix the trigger OR add nightly catch-up scan.

## 2. Ship-assist tooling inventory

### Tier 1 — Per-PR operator actions (you'll use these every session)
| Tool | Purpose | When to reach |
|---|---|---|
| `chump preflight` (INFRA-1670) | Local CI gate; ~60s warm | Before every push touching Rust or `scripts/` |
| `chump claim INFRA-X --paths <CSV>` | Atomic gap claim + worktree + lease | Before any work on a gap |
| `scripts/coord/bot-merge.sh --gap X --auto-merge` | Push + PR + arm + release lease (one-shot) | Default ship path |
| `gh pr merge N --auto --squash` | Manual auto-merge arm | Fallback when bot-merge wedges (Class 4) |
| `scripts/coord/auto-merge-armer.sh` | Bulk arm auto-merge across queue | When multiple PRs need re-arming after rebase |
| `rm -f .chump-locks/claim-<gap>-*.json` | Manual lease release | When bot-merge didn't release; cleaner than `chump --release` for orphaned leases |

### Tier 2 — Wedge response (you'll use these when something is stuck)
| Tool | Wedge class | Today's evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/ops/break-trunk-cascade.sh --pr N --reason "..."` (INFRA-2087) | Trunk-RED cascade — operator-button for the drop-rulesets + admin-merge + restore dance | Rate-limited 1/hr |
| `scripts/ops/rotate-sccache-r2-gh-only.sh --execute` (INFRA-2240) | Class 3 sccache R2 pair-mismatch (PRIMARY rotation path) | Shipped today, PR #2795 |
| `scripts/ops/rotate-sccache-r2-token.sh --execute` (INFRA-2237) | Class 3 sccache R2 (CF-API automation backup) | Shipped today, PR #2793 |
| `bash scripts/ci/check-required-checks-non-empty.sh` (INFRA-2201) | Empty `required_status_checks` (silent open gates) | Shipped INFRA-2201 today |
| Manual sed-scrub + `chump gap set --acceptance-criteria` with `CHUMP_ALLOW_GAP_REWRITE=1` | Gap registry hygiene drift | Used today on INFRA-2246-cluster scrub |

### Tier 3 — Curator skills (slash commands; per role-lane orchestration)
| Skill | Lane | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `/shepherd` | PR rescue + merge health | Pattern-14 evidence-gathering + Pattern-15 ship-something-every-cycle |
| `/ci-audit` | CI failure decomposition | Classify wedge into flake / logic-bug / missing-gate; dispatch Sonnet on flakes |
| `/handoff` | Typed dispatch | DecomposeContract / CodeFixContract / GapReviewContract instead of free-form prompts |
| `/fleet-doctor` | Strict health invariants | Single command yes/no answer on fleet health (7 invariants) |
| `/fleet-brief` | 60-sec operator briefing | Session start; pillar mix; stalls; alerts |
| `/operator-recall` | Halt-class paging | AUTH_DEAD / COST_CAP / CI_BROKEN / QUEUE_STARVE |
| `/decompose` | Umbrella → sub-gap slicing | Two-phase decomposition at claim time |
| `/md-links` | Docs link integrity | Stale gap references, broken cross-refs |
| `/infra-watcher` | SRE-lane substrate health | Daemon plists, runner ghost-online, disk pressure |
| `/observability` | Telemetry tuning | Event registry hygiene, reaper cadence, cost leaderboard |

### Tier 4 — Tooling that DOES NOT EXIST YET (filed gaps)
| Missing tool | Gap | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Local CI gate (no network) | INFRA-2251 | P0 (today's incident → 10× urgency) |
| Local merge queue (offline) | INFRA-2252 | P1 |
| Auto-wedge-file from ambient `kind=wedge_class_detected` | INFRA-2068 | P1 |
| Wedge-fixer auto-dispatch with template library | INFRA-2069 | P1 |
| Cascade-unblock detector (auto-rebase queue after fix lands) | INFRA-2070 | P1 |
| Admin-merge frequency circuit-breaker | INFRA-2071 | P1 |
| No-revert-loop guard for auto-fixer | INFRA-2075 | P1 |
| `chump paramedic CI_FAILURE` action | INFRA-1713 | P1 |
| bot-merge stall wall-clock monitor + auto-bail | INFRA-1399 | P1 |
| `chump claim --force-recover --discard-wip` safety + audit | INFRA-2235 | P1 |
| Auto-flip-on-merge silent miss + nightly catch-up | INFRA-2230 | P1 |
| Network sync daemon (offline→online replay) | INFRA-1322 | P1 |
| `CHUMP_GITHUB_MODE=offline` auto-detect knob | INFRA-1325 | P2 |

## 3. Decision flow — given a wedge, which tool first?

```
Wedge symptom → identify class → first-tool → fallback chain

fmt-drift queue-wide
  → fmt-sweep gap (xs/P0) → ship via bot-merge → drains queue
  → fallback: manual gh pr merge if bot-merge wedges

raw-gh-allowlist queue-wide
  → 1-line allowlist add (xs/P0) → bot-merge → drains queue

sccache R2 unauthorized cross-PR
  → check `gh secret list -R repairman29/chump | grep R2_`
  → if pair-mismatch: rotate-sccache-r2-gh-only.sh (primary, INFRA-2240)
  → if pair was rotated recently but still failing: rotate-sccache-r2-token.sh (CF-API, INFRA-2237) OR re-rotate
  → operator action; cannot agent-fix without CF API token

trunk-RED + queue-blocked >20m
  → /ci-audit decompose
  → if classified flake: dispatch Sonnet rerun
  → if classified logic bug: file gap, dispatch Sonnet fix
  → if classified missing-gate: break-trunk-cascade.sh + INFRA-1274-style allowlist add

bot-merge.sh runs >4 min no output
  → SIGTERM the bot-merge process
  → manual recovery: gh push + create + merge --auto + rm lease file
  → bypass trailers in commit: Bot-Merge-Bypass + Test-Gate-Bypass

Sonnet sub-agent stalled (600s no progress)
  → check /tmp/chump-<gap-id> for WIP
  → if WIP exists: commit-as-WIP, don't --force-recover
  → re-dispatch with recovery notes documenting the stall point

gap status:open after merge to main
  → manual flip: CHUMP_GAP_SHIP_SKIP_STALE_CHECK=1 CHUMP_BYPASS_PROOF_OF_MERGE=1 chump gap ship X --closed-pr N --update-yaml
  → batch-sweep recent merges weekly (until INFRA-2230 ships)
```

## 4. Top-3 highest-leverage missing gaps (file/promote/ship-next)

Today's evidence ranked by "would have saved how much time today":

1. **INFRA-2251 (P0/s) — local CI gate `scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh`** — eliminates the entire "remote service hiccup wedges queue" class. ~50% of today's pain disappears with this gap shipped. Was previously a ghost reference in OFFLINE_FIRST.md as INFRA-1320; filed for real today.

2. **META-118 chain (INFRA-2068/2069/2070/2071/2075) — auto-wedge-classify-and-dispatch** — turns each Pattern-14 incident I drilled today into a fleet-level reflex. Each sub-gap is filed; INFRA-2071 is ~90% done (Sonnet pickup in flight from this dispatch). Combined effect: today's manual cycles 5/6/7/12 become "Sonnet auto-fixed it before operator noticed."

3. **INFRA-1713 (P1/s) — `chump paramedic CI_FAILURE` action** — diagnose top failing check, dispatch rescue Sonnet, close the BLOCKED-with-CI-failure class. Pairs with INFRA-1429 (stale-branch auto-rebase) for the full auto-rescue layer. Sonnet dispatched on this in the current parallel wave.

**Bonus P1 — INFRA-1399 (bot-merge stall wall-clock monitor)** — today's 3 occurrences cost ~15-20 min each. Wall-clock progress monitor with auto-bail to manual fallback would save ~1 hr / day in heavy ship sessions.

## 5. Reliability lessons + audit log

Each of these is captured in the cited gap; this section is the index:

- **bot-merge.sh silent wedge** → INFRA-1399 (filed pre-today)
- **`--force-recover` destroys WIP** → INFRA-2235 (filed today, cycle 14)
- **Sonnet stall recovery pattern** → INFRA-2071 notes (cycle 13 evidence) + INFRA-2235 cross-ref
- **gap-status auto-flip silently no-ops** → INFRA-2230 (filed today, cycle 11)
- **OFFLINE_FIRST.md ghost gap IDs (INFRA-1320, 1321 never filed)** → INFRA-2251 + INFRA-2252 (filed today, cycle 16-ish)
- **`chump-proprietary` exposure in PR titles/bodies** → 17 hits scrubbed via mass sed + state.db AC/notes overwrite (cycle 16); future `chump gap set` ops use `CHUMP_ALLOW_GAP_REWRITE=1` to bypass INFRA-456 hijack guard
- **Sccache R2 pair-mismatch root cause** → both rotation scripts shipped today (INFRA-2237 CF-API + INFRA-2240 GH-only); operator runbook in `docs/process/SCCACHE_R2_CACHE.md`
- **`chump gap reserve` boilerplate TODO ACs** → operator memory `feedback_gaps_always_have_ac.md` — fill concrete AC immediately on every reserve
- **Pattern 14 (verify before alarm)** → `docs/process/SHEPHERD_LOOP_PLAYBOOK.md` + `CLAUDE.md` L196 (shipped earlier today via PR #2762)
- **Pattern 15 (no idle curators)** → same playbook (shipped today)

## 6. Today's session — what shipped, what didn't

This section is the audit trail. Future shepherds reading the wedge-class table above can cross-reference here for "did Opus actually ship that fix today, or is it still a gap?"

## Class 8 — Shelfware (daemon shipped but never wired into any curator doc)

**Symptom.** A daemon, CLI, or plist exists on disk and runs via launchd, but no `.claude/agents/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `docs/process/*.md` mentions it. The operator discovers it only when something breaks.
**Detection.** `bash scripts/coord/quartermaster-audit-loop.sh run` — scans merged commits, greps role-doc tree, emits `kind=shelfware_detected` for orphaned artifacts.
**Fix.** File a wiring gap (EFFECTIVE, P1/s) via the Quartermaster daemon. The gap AC is: add a section to the appropriate curator role doc, add the artifact to `scripts/setup/bootstrap-manifest.yaml` if it's a launchd plist.
**Prevention.** Quartermaster daemon fires after every 5 ships or after 30 min idle. Any new `scripts/coord/*.sh` or `scripts/launchd/*.plist` that doesn't appear in a role doc within 24h of merge generates a `shelfware_detected` event.

## Class 9 — Quartermaster auto-fixers (META-225)

Three daemons that eliminate the three manual unwedging classes the operator had to approve on 2026-05-30. These run continuously without operator involvement.

**Operator-visible cheat sheet:**

| Daemon | Cadence | Detects | Auto-action | Ambient kind |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `daemon-activator-loop.sh` | Every 5 min | New `install-*.sh` or `*.plist` on `origin/main` with label not in `launchctl list` | Runs the installer | `daemon_auto_activated` / `daemon_activator_failed` |
| `ghost-pr-closer.sh` | Every 15 min | Open PR (DIRTY or CONFLICTING) whose gap is `status:done` | Closes PR with comment | `ghost_pr_closed` |
| `main-worktree-drift-detector.sh` | Every 30 min | >50 untracked yaml OR >20 commits behind `origin/main` in main worktree | Emits alert + reserves cleanup gap | `main_worktree_drift_detected` |

**Install / verify:**
```bash
# Install once after META-225 merges:
bash scripts/setup/install-daemon-activator.sh
bash scripts/setup/install-ghost-pr-closer.sh
bash scripts/setup/install-main-worktree-drift-detector.sh

# Verify all three are running:
launchctl list | grep -E "com.chump.(daemon-activator|ghost-pr-closer|main-worktree-drift-detector)"
```

**Logs:**
```
~/.chump/logs/daemon-activator.{out,err}
~/.chump/logs/ghost-pr-closer.{out,err}
~/.chump/logs/main-worktree-drift-detector.{out,err}
```

**Ambient stream monitoring:**
```bash
tail -50 .chump-locks/ambient.jsonl | grep -E '"kind":"(daemon_auto_activated|daemon_activator_failed|ghost_pr_closed|main_worktree_drift_detected)"'
```

**Decision doctrine:** `docs/process/SHEPHERD_AUTONOMY_LADDER.md` — full approval matrix for which unwedging moves are auto-execute vs. operator-approve.

**If a daemon is not running:**
```bash
# Reinstall (idempotent):
bash scripts/setup/install-<daemon-name>.sh

# Or check bootstrap manifest:
bash scripts/setup/chump-fleet-bootstrap.sh --check
```

---

## Maintenance

This playbook should be **updated whenever a new wedge class is discovered** (new entry in §1), a **new ship-assist tool ships** (entry added to §2), or a **lesson-learning gap closes** (move from §4/§5 in-flight to §6 shipped + cross-link the doc to the fix's PR).

If a future loop session uncovers ≥3 new wedge classes that aren't here, the playbook should be re-audited rather than just appended — the taxonomy may need restructuring.
