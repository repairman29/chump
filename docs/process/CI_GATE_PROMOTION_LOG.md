# CI Gate Promotion Log

> INFRA-1869 (META-074 / INFRA-1861 slice d). Append-only log of CI gates
> that have been promoted from `--warn-only` (advisory) to `strict-fail`
> (mandatory). Once a gate is in this log, it MUST stay strict — demoting
> it requires an explicit `CI-Promotion-Reverted: <reason>` commit trailer
> AND a new entry below documenting the demotion + why.
>
> Enforcement: `scripts/ci/test-gate-promotion-no-regression.sh` parses
> this file and fails the build if any listed gate is currently
> `--warn-only` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or sibling workflow files).

## Why this log exists

CI gates exist on a maturity ladder: file → warn-only → strict-fail.
The expensive direction is *backwards*: a strict gate that's flipped
back to warn-only because someone got tired of seeing failures silently
gives back the discipline. Without an explicit log, the regression is
invisible — a PR can demote a gate in a one-line diff that reviewers
miss. This log makes demotion an explicit, audited act.

## Schema

Each entry is a markdown sub-heading with a structured body:

```markdown
## <gate-name>

- **Promoted at:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
- **CI file:** path/to/workflow.yml
- **CI line (anchor):** name-of-step OR line:NN
- **Promoted by:** <gap-id or commit-sha>
- **Reason:** <one-sentence why it should never demote>
- **Demoted at:** (only on demotion, with `CI-Promotion-Reverted:` trailer ref)
- **Demoted by:** (only on demotion, gap-id or commit-sha)
- **Demote reason:** (only on demotion, why we accepted the regression)
```

## Promoted gates (v1)

> The initial list is empty — this PR ships the framework. Gates promoted
> after this lands MUST be appended here. The fleet has several gates
> already running strict today (cargo fmt, cargo clippy -D warnings,
> docs-delta, env-vars-internal, gaps-integrity, etc.); back-filling those
> into this log is a follow-up gap so we don't conflate "promoted from
> warn-only" with "born strict".

## test-preflight-ci-parity

- **Promoted at:** 2026-05-29 00:00:00 UTC
- **CI file:** .github/workflows/ci.yml
- **CI line (anchor):** preflight-vs-CI parity smoke (INFRA-1867)
- **Promoted by:** INFRA-2120
- **Reason:** allowlist drift between `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
  `chump preflight` is the rank-2 CI-rot class (~15% of recent CI failures
  per docs/strategy/CI_REVIEW_2026-05-29.md Lever 4). Gate must stay strict
  so a CI-config addition without a matching preflight mirror (or
  exceptions entry) fails at the workflow step instead of leaking out as
  silent "local-green-CI-red" surprises. Also fired locally by the
  pre-commit hook (see CLAUDE.md "Local CI discipline"). The slug
  `test-preflight-ci-parity` matches the script basename, which is
  referenced in `bash scripts/ci/test-preflight-ci-parity.sh` on the
  promoted step.

## Demoted gates

> Hopefully this stays empty. Every entry here is a discipline regression
> that an operator accepted as the lesser evil. Track 'em.

## Adding an entry (workflow)

When promoting a CI gate from `--warn-only` to strict:

1. In the same PR that flips the gate:
2. Append a new entry to "Promoted gates" with all fields filled
3. Commit body MUST cite the gate name explicitly so the audit log
   surfaces it
4. The next `test-gate-promotion-no-regression.sh` run validates that
   the gate is now strict in the workflow file

When (reluctantly) demoting:

1. In the same PR that flips the gate back:
2. Add `CI-Promotion-Reverted: <one-sentence-reason>` to the commit body
   (the pre-push hook checks for this trailer)
3. Update the existing entry under "Promoted gates" to mark `Demoted at`
   + `Demote reason` (don't remove — preserve audit trail)
4. Move the entry to "Demoted gates" section
5. File a follow-up INFRA-NEW gap to fix the underlying cause + re-promote
